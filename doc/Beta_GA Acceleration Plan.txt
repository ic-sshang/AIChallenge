This plan evaluates how additional engineering resources can accelerate the PayFac program’s Beta and GA milestones while maintaining Alpha’s fixed February 2026 launch.
Assumptions:
Existing capacity:
 3 teams × ~30 pts/sprint = 
90 pts per 2-week sprint
.
Alpha:
 
fixed; 
launches 
Feb 2026
; 
hold 
1 stabilization sprint
 (2 weeks) right after launch to handle unexpected launch issues
New hires:
 
distributed across existing teams; 
arrive end 
Oct 2025
; 
training in Q4.
Ramp:
 ~65% productive in 
Jan 2026
, 100% from Feb 2026 onward.
Beta size:
 ~915 points
GA scope
: ~600 points (current estimation)
Team “equivalent” for math:
 4 eng + 1 SDET ≈ 
30 pts/sprint
 → 
~6 pts/sprint per added person
.

Takeaway:
 
Alpha
: remains fixed at Feb 2026 launch; added resources have no impact.
Beta
:
Current trajectory (no hires) → 
late July 2026
.
With 6 new engineers + senior engineer reallocation → 
mid-May 2026
 (≈2 months faster).
With 10–12 hires → 
April 2026
 finish.
GA
:
Current trajectory (no hires + ~600 points) → 
Dec 2026
.
With ~6 hires → 
Oct 2026
.
With 10–12 hires → 
Aug–Sep 2026
.
 
Pull-forward during Jan/stabilization adds ~1–2 weeks vs. sequential. The main lever is velocity after stabilization.

Recommendation
Recommend adding 
6 
engineering resources (distributed across existing teams, with ramp-up starting in Q4 2025).
Why 6 hires is the optimal balance:
Acceleration Benefit:
 Brings Beta forward by ~2 months (mid-May ’26 vs. late July ’26) and GA forward by ~2 months (Aug ’26 vs. Oct '26).
Manageable Integration:
 3 hires per team is operationally absorbable. Larger groups risk higher onboarding overhead leading to slower ramp-up.
Cost vs. ROI:
 6 hires deliver a significant time-to-market gain. 
Risk Buffer:
 Maintains a stabilization cushion post-Alpha and reduces the risk of slipping into 2027, while avoiding the brittleness that comes with overloading teams.
