To import a Remote State Resource, first you need to prep the Repo locally by adding the 
organization
 and 
workspace
to the 
cloud{}
 block as demonstrated below:
hcl
terraform {
  cloud {
    organization = "InoviceCloud"

    workspaces {
      name = "avd-workspace-pri-eus-npd-1"
    }
  }

  required_providers {
    azurerm = "~> 3.112.0"
    azapi = {
      source  = "azure/azapi"
      version = "1.13.1"
    }
  }
}
Also you need to provide values for all of the Variables that do not have defaults in the Terraform Repo you are trying to import against.
Then run the following commands to log into the Terrasform Cloud Organization and initialize the repo against the Workspace Remote State:
terraform login

terraform init
Finally run the Import Remote State Resource command as demonstrated below:
powershell
terraform import 'azurerm_virtual_machine_extension.avd_register_to_hostpool["pvd-Vregonda1"]' /subscriptions/630f6476-2a4d-4faf-8e49-99c119eb08df/resourceGroups/rg-pri-eus-avd1/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/vm-pvd-Vregonda1-pri-eus-avd1-prd/extensions/avd-register-pvd-Vregonda1-pri-eus-avd1-prd
