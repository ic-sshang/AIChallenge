Color Updates:
utility-blue-5 changes from #F4F7FB to #E9F1FB
utility-blue-10 changes from #E9EFF7 to #D9E7F8
Alerts 
 added great documentation to guide when to use dismissible vs non-dismissible
tldr: use dismissible alerts for success alerts and informational/warning alerts that are not critical
Use non-dismissible alerts for all error messaging and critical information that will warn users of cascading affects of their actions or mandatory messaging (i.e. “Autopay users must be enrolled in Paperless”)
Icon size variant
24x24px is not being used anywhere and will be deleted as an icon sizing option
Kebab Menu
