There was a significant decrease in submitted tickets with reported service “reCAPTCHA” in January 2025, 
1 ticket 
submitted compared to 
18
 
tickets 
submitted in January 2024. 
The most common biller/customer concern with reCAPTCHA is that individuals get stuck in a repetitive reCAPTCHA challenge loop, stopping customers from proceeding to payment.

 was released April 2nd, 2024, alleviating much of the reCAPTCHA issues for IP addresses.
Occasionally, there is a spike in IP addresses that need to be added via the Biller Support Tool. Although IP addresses can be added to the whitelist, the CS agent must have the necessary permissions enabled to save to the list, which they may not yet have.
Tickets are also submitted when the Biller or Customer experiences multiple issues with reCAPTCHA. In this case, EBPP items are necessary to completely remove reCAPTCHA from occurring for the entire BID.

There was almost a 50% increase in Autopay tickets submitted in February 2025, with 
13
 
tickets
 as opposed to 
7
 
tickets
 in 2024.
The most common issues with Autopay in February were related to Autopay payment method change history (5), Autopay not processing (4), and additional information for Autopay features (3). 
Autopay payment method change history: 
Issue: When the Biller Users/Customers remove the default payment method of the Autopay setup and do not change the payment method when prompted, the Autopay setup is now in a bad state, where “Attention Required” is shown in the Biller/Customer portal.
Action Item: 
EBPP-18549
2278e126-27dc-36c8-aef9-a32d91bc7ad7

  created. 
A potential solution could be a reminder email sent to the customer that their Autopay setup requires attention, or a report/graph in the Biller portal to show the number of customers that have this warning to Biller users.

Issue: 
A customer's autopay payment method was changed to a different saved payment method than what Autopay was set up to use. We were unable to determine the root cause of how the saved payment method was changed due to the lack of sufficient logging for the autopay payment method changes.
The following were action items that were created to better our system for these types of issues: 
EBPP-27147
: Prevent invalid payment records from being used for autopay and scheduled payments.
DBR-6467
: Set up a daily alert through an automated daily report to identify any new records that are in the invalid data state for all billers facing this issue.
EBPP-27148
: Add logs to track changes in specific processes that handle payment methods for customers.
EBPP-27149
: Review and improve the logs that track changes in various tables related to customer login and payment information.
EBPP-27150
: Investigate and discuss the best way to centralize and standardize all login and linking functionality.
SR-1332
: Add new logs to the centralized login system to make it more useful for our Client Services team.

 was added on 2/24/2025  to the

  and is #24 priority. 
Could potentially be a quick win for the SRE SPAM team since it requires a change to the 
bcg.selCustomerGroupInvoiceLedgerFilteredIndCustomer
 so that invoices that are inactive are not picked up, and testing in MYIIS and ICRestAPI to verify that the inactive invoices are not listed.
