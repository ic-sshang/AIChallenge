 Signed Initialization Token:
A 
Signed Initialization Token
 is typically a 
JWT (JSON Web Token)
 generated by your backend. It securely contains user or session information and is passed to a Web Component when it is embedded into a host application. This allows the component to operate with trusted, authenticated context—without requiring re-authentication.
Purpose and Advantages:
When embedding a Web Component into third-party or external applications, it is essential to establish a secure and reliable method for initializing the component with contextual information. A 
Signed Initialization Token
—typically a JWT—provides a stateless and tamper-proof mechanism for:
Conveying user identity and session details
Communicating authorization roles or permissions
Enforcing time-bound validity through token expiration
This approach ensures the Web Component can operate securely and independently, without requiring direct authentication flows or reliance on the host environment.
Initialization Workflow
The end user loads your page or host site.
Your 
.NET backend
 generates a JWT that contains the relevant claims (such as userId, role, etc.).
The backend injects this token into the HTML page, typically as an attribute in the custom element (e.g., <secure-widget token="JWT_VALUE"></secure-widget>).
The Web Component reads the token and can:
Decode it to render UI based on the payload.
Send it to your API for secure data access.
Token Integration in Web Components
When you define your Web Component using 
IcReactwebify
, you can treat the token as a prop. At runtime, the component will receive the token as an attribute, parse it, and use it for initializing state or requesting secure data.
This method avoids environment injection and allows easy integration with backend-issued, stateless session data.
Security Considerations
Concern
Recommended Solution
Token tampering
Sign JWTs using a secure, private key (never expose this in frontend).
Token expiration
Include short-lived expiration (e.g., 15–30 minutes).
Replay attacks
Include session/user identifiers or a unique nonce.
Token exposure in DOM
Avoid placing JWT in visible or global JavaScript scope.
Trust validation
Always validate JWTs on the server before granting access.
HTML Integration Example
You can include the token-enabled Web Component like this in a consuming app:
html
html
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://cdn.yoursite.com/components/secure-widget.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <secure-widget token="YOUR_JWT_TOKEN_FROM_BACKEND"></secure-widget>
  </body>
</html>
Summary
A Signed Initialization Token is a secure and scalable method to initialize Web Components with authenticated data. It allows you to embed React-based widgets in any frontend (React, Angular, plain HTML) while maintaining trust and security, especially in cross-domain or multi-tenant deployments.
