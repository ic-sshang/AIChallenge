What Went Well?
What Went Less Well?
Try Next?
What puzzles?
Started SecureAuth changes, and library endpoints integrated as well
Great teamwork was shown in handling the new SecureAuth API changes
Gained good clarity on how to implement and test the Secure Auth client and service layers
Great coordination was there. 
Co-ordination was well between Tanya and Kunwardeep.
Project structure created by Santosh and Sudhakar helping team to go in right direction for SSO/ MFA.
Initial challenges for IC Secure Auth framework changes, since the structure was decided simultaneously with the development of stories.
One story spilled over, but we’ve already completed a major portion of it, so it’s well-positioned to be wrapped up early in the next sprint.
One item was not completed and spilled over. Our action item is to refine such stories better and allocate buffer for unexpected complexity.
Identify blockers and appropriately gauge your capacity to complete stories to avoid spillovers.
We realized that identifying and preparing common code logic earlier would help the sprint run more smoothly. This learning will help us avoid minor disruptions in future sprints.
Daily code commits.
Get details on UI(CRM) and Database. 
Faced slight delay in finalizing API structure and test data.
Difficulty in daily code commits.
