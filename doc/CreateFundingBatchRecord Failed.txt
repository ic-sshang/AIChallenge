If the CreateFundingBatchRecord failed, pull down the branch “ManualRunForFiservForReceiptNameError“ on MC_RPPS. Under MC_RPPS.UnitTests>Utilities, find UnitTest1.vb.

If the credit count is more than 1 then the credit volume will be different than what is in the request from the log. For example:
Request from Log:
Updated Request:
We want to take a screenshot of the request and response and sent it over to Randy, and we want to stop at the response.
