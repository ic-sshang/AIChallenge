Step 1: Create an Application Information Page in Confluence
Use the Application Information Template
Navigate to the 
Platform Modernization - Kubernetes space
 designated for application documentation.
Click 
“Create from Template”
 and select 
“
Template - Application Information
”
.
Fill in the following sections:
Application Overview
Development Team Contact Information
Technical Details
Deployment Information
Web Ingress (optional, only for Web and API workloads) 
Store your copy of the application form under the 
Systems
 in a new page named after your Code Repository.
Step 2: Create an Application Architecture Overview Page in Confluence
The overview should have:
Overview section briefly describing the application
High level diagram illustrating the primary components and how they interact
Store under the application information page in 
Systems
 
Step 3: Schedule a Platform Review Meeting
Schedule a 30-minute onboarding meeting with the platform team (
#kubernetes-support
) along with your team's architect to review the above pages and deliverables.  
Outcomes of the Platform Review Meeting
A Repo will be created for the Application
Note, we specifically limit the creation Repos to certain Personas as a Governance measure, so this process is followed
An Item will be backlogged and scheduled to add the Application Service to a Kubernetes Cluster
If a different Azure PaaS Resource is to be used then an Item will be Backlogged for the creation of that those Resources.
If needed, Jira Item(s) for the creation or configuration of any Azure Resources outside of the Kubernetes Cluster such as Service Bus Queues/Topics, Storage Accounts, Database Servers, etc…
An Item will be backlogged and scheduled to add the Build pipeline
An Item will be backlogged and scheduled to add the Deploy Pipeline and Helm Chart Value files for Each Environment
If needed, an Item will be backlogged and scheduled to add support for Kong Routing which will be Terraformed
If needed, an Item will be backlogged and scheduled to add support for NewRelic Dashboards which will be Terraformed
If needed, an Item will be backlogged and scheduled to add support for NewRelic Alerts which will be Terraformed
Reason for the Process
Enforcing an 
application onboarding process
 is a key governance practice that ensures consistency, security, and operational reliability across an organization’s technology landscape. Here's a breakdown of the governance reasoning behind it:
🛡️ 1. 
Security and Compliance
Ensures that applications meet 
security standards
 before going live.
Validates that sensitive data is handled according to 
regulatory requirements
 (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR).
Confirms that secrets, credentials, and access controls are properly managed.
⚙️ 2. 
Operational Readiness
Verifies that monitoring, logging, and alerting are in place.
Confirms that the application integrates with incident response and support workflows.
Ensures that scaling and resource limits are defined to prevent outages.
📦 3. 
Standardization and Consistency
Promotes use of 
approved patterns and tools
 (e.g., CI/CD pipelines, container images).
Reduces technical debt by enforcing architectural standards.
Makes it easier to maintain and troubleshoot applications across teams.
📊 4. 
Auditability and Traceability
Creates a documented trail of decisions, configurations, and approvals.
Supports internal and external audits by showing that governance controls are applied.
Helps track ownership, lifecycle status, and dependencies.
🚀 5. 
Faster, Safer Deployments
Reduces risk of production issues by catching misconfigurations early.
Enables smoother handoffs between development, operations, and security teams.
Encourages automation and repeatability in deployment processes.
