This biller is currently using the “IF_Munis Adjustment v18” file conversion format for their parking ticket adjustments. However, since 12/21/2021, they have not had a successful adjustment file conversion of this type.
Raw adjustment file can be converted into a BAF file.
Biller decided to ignore the unexpected text in parking adjustment file. New file conversion for parking adjustment files will be used to handle the additional text.
