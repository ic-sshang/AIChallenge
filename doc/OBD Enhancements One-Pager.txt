Problem Alignment
Problem: What is the friction or opportunity?
We received a variety of requests to improve OBD reporting and functionality.  A few areas of concern include customization of auto match criteria, pending payments volume and suggested match results, and general OBD setup flexibility.
Why: How do we know this is a real problem and worth solving?
The problem was realized through feedback (HD tickets) and NPS results from billers.
Audience: Who are we building this for?
Billers 
- Our clients will benefit from spending less time attempting to manually match pending payments.
Biller Support
 - This team will benefit from fewer HD tickets for assistance matching pending payments, or researching why certain items did not auto match.
Success: How do we know if we’ve solved this problem?
Our goal is to improve the efficacy of the auto match process to thereby reduce the time spent by our billers having to manually process pending payments.
