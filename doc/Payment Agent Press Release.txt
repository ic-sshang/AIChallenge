InvoiceCloud Revolutionizes Biller Experience with Nimbus AI Payment Agent
[Boston, MA] – [March 7, 2025] – InvoiceCloud, a leading provider of secure, cloud-based digital bill payment solutions, today announced the launch of Nimbus, an innovative AI Payment Agent designed to enhance the customer experience for billers. Nimbus addresses critical pain points, including broken user experiences during payment processes and the lack of real-time support for payment and non-payment inquiries.
Billers often face challenges when customers leave their websites to complete payments on external platforms, leading to a fragmented user experience and increased support calls. Nimbus seamlessly integrates with billers' websites, ensuring customers can complete transactions without leaving the site. Additionally, Nimbus provides real-time support for payment-related issues, reducing the burden on call centers and increasing online transaction rates.
"Nimbus is a game-changer for our billers," said Dennis Chin, Product Lead at InvoiceCloud. "We’re harnessing the power of AI and large language models to help our billers build better rapport with their customers through stellar customer service. Nimbus aims to improve first-time contact resolution metrics for both payment and non-payment inquiries, ultimately enhancing the overall customer experience."
InvoiceCloud’s AI Payment Agent, Nimbus, offers several key benefits:
Unified Customer Experience
: Customers can complete payments directly on the biller's website, eliminating the need to navigate to external sites.
Real-Time Support
