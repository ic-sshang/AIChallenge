Overall considerations: 
Track changes at the user and account level for billers
 - All products being moved from account to user level. We should still track changes at the account level for billers who want us to data pump autopay and/or paperless enrollment at the account level AND user level.
Web services review
 - Review all current web services to see where updates are needed to values that have moved to the ‘user’ level (work already complete) and also do a review when we go through these additional project items to ensure we continue updating the web services with the new updates.
We will also coordinate with billers and partners that may be using the web services that we change/update for testing purposes. Product and implementations will work to find billers and partners that would be able to help.

Payer Use Cases: 
Payers are currently limited in their ability to use features like pay by text, IVR, autopay, and paperless because we are not able to authenticate user roles or save payment methods by user rather than the account level. There are also some improvements to be made related to consistent user experience for owners and co-owners. 
Owner and co-owner is an internal distinction for IC and billers. 
Payers that are co-owners should have the same permissions and screens as owners with no distinction.
 There should not be a mention in the payer portal of “co-owner” (and there does not appear to be now). Potential improvements include:
Managing users, and manage accounts screens should be the same for both
The inviting users screen should be the same for both
An account guest should not have the ability to manage or invite users
An account oversight role should not have the ability to manage or invite users

2. Currently, with MultiCustomer Login, once the account is first registered, we assume that the first user registering the account is the Owner. However, in the scenario of Tenant/Landlord where the Landlord doesn’t use online to pay the bill, but the Tenant wants to, the Tenant registers the account and becomes the “Owner”. The true “Owner” is the Landlord, but they didn’t go online to register. 
We could have a unique identifier (a numeric code for example that would be passed in our Custom field, for example, field Custom58 that isn’t being used by any software partner, so this could be used with all billers) that only the true Owner would know. Other codes could represent different owner type. (example O100 for Owner, C200 for Co-Owner, OS300 for Oversight, G500 for Guest).  At the time of registration, this unique code can be a part of the registration process to grant that level of access for the Owner type of the account.

3. Pay by text should be available at the user level, not just for the account owner. As an account guest or oversight, you should be able to use the 
existing pay by text flow
 instead of having it be disabled. This would mean we have to be able to store payment information and phone numbers on a user level. 
We currently store a ‘phone number’ at the account level that is not associated with the pay by text phone number. What we want to see in enrollment is storing the PBT enrollment phone number at the user level (and possibly in the future, also storing a ‘phone number’ field at the user level - still not associated with PBT). 
An account may then have multiple payment methods and phone numbers stored to it. 
In order to make this work, we would need to have a level of user authentication to enroll in pay by text via one-time pay. 
Additionally, pay by text should show “edit” instead of “view” in the payer portal.

. Autopay should be available for multiple users registered to the same account.
 Currently, both owners and co-owners can edit autopay. However, there is an inability to enroll in autopay during the one-time payment route. This feature request is to allow autopay enrollment during one-time pay with user authentication.

5. Related to enabling functionality for users, we should update the IVR payment method storage to account for user authentication. In order to fix this, saving and updating IVR payment methods was disabled for all users, including account owners. All users registered to an account should be able to store, and then use the stored payment method on their user account for the payment. This may include changes to the payment flow of IVR.

6. ‘One click pay' in email notifications should use the default payment method of the user the email is being sent to rather than the account owner’s payment method. A guest user that gets the payment notification that clicks on the one-click pay button in the email will get the owner’s payment information to make the payment. If the guest has their own payment method entered it is not shown as the default. This will be the same for account oversights and guest, they should be able to pay with their own saved method, not that of the owner.

7. 
Paperless functionality
 sits at the account level, not the user level. We need to be able to segment this functionality by user, not just for the account owner. An account guest or oversight may want to user paperless, but an owner (in the case of a property owner for instance) might not want to enable this.

Biller Use Cases: 
There is an open question about the design of the biller portal for multi-user accounts. Billers looking to help payers with password issues, finding payment methods, and seeing which users are connected to an account are issues related to biller portal design not reflecting the multi-user world. 
1.
 A biller cannot tell which payment method belongs to which user when looking at an account owner's bank or card payment options. We want to know which user login the payment type is associated with (so that if they plan to add a payment method or remove one for a user, they know which user they’re editing). The request is to add a column to the table here to show which users, usernames, and account permissions are stored as payment methods. Billers may want to be able to cross-reference payment methods to payment methods they see on an account and if they know that they would be able to contact the offending user.

2. Since we should be storing ACH and CC at the user level, billers need the ability to block ACH and block CC indicators at the user level. In multi-user integrations, billers may want/need to block specific users OR the whole account if needed. Right now, a biller can only block at the account level which they may not want to do.

3. Billers want to be able to make the account holder the account owner and shift other users down to co-owner status without unregistering the accounts first. The most common use case is when roommates sign up for e+ and link a utility account prior to the actual account holder, which makes them the account owner.

Go-Live Blocker. 
We need to update CSRconnect to pass the user credentials (or something to denote which user is being accessed). There are a few multi-user scenarios needed to be updated to better work with CSRconnect. There is an open question related to how we will interact with CSRconnect on the user level and not on the account level. 
Scenario 1:
CSR at Biller 123 receives call from Brett.
Brett asks CSR to store CC and register for AutoPay.
Login to Daffron. Brett has never registered before.
CSR Connect will create a ghost record for Brett.
Then Zach comes in via web and registers the same account number.
Will Zach's registration now control Brett's user profile?
Yes. Zach is registering the Customer Account first and since there are payment methods tied to the Account Owner login, will inherit the payment methods.
Scenario 2:
Two users registered.
One jumps in via CSR Connect.
Which account/user profile will CSR Connect jump to?
Account Owner. CSR Connect only works with Account Owners today.

2. When we turn on McLogin for a biller, we want to be able to automatically have the permissions set up and not everyone is set as Owner. The Biller Customer Imports tool in CRM should allow the Registered User Conversion Import to include a value for the LogInTypeID (permission ID for new payer account permission level).
