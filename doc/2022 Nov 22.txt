Process initiative
Bug and INT items had to be reviewed by Sam or Jonathan. We are getting items moved back to us and reflects on us badly.
CS Review is back in Vogue 
The CS_Review process is defined:
The triage lead will review all our incoming requests.
Dashboard link for CS Review - 
https://invoicecloud.atlassian.net/jira/dashboards/10203
What this means to the process is
CS_Review_Details - For any ticket that lacks details, we will take this to be an opportunity to bring attention so that the ticket completeness improves over time and identify training gaps.
CS_Review - This is in addition to DS providing solutions or guru links which CS could have handled without reaching DS.
Triage and Assignment Process
