Problem Statement
Currently, when users are redirected from the InvoiceCloud customer portal to an external platform (e.g., AquaHawk to review usage data) they are required to authenticate 
again. 
This:
Requires payers have 2 different logins to view their invoice and see meter usage data by account
Creates a disjointed experience
Increases friction, especially for non-technical users
Causes confusion or cart abandonment
Disallows Billers with AMI products to integrate
Business Context & Goals
Goals
Provide customers ability to seamlessly access their usage data without requiring multiple logins
Ensure customers pay their bill
Win deals with Billers that have AMI products or want this feature
Better Customer Experience
Solving this problem adds value to the InvoiceCloud platform:
Offers a better customer experience
Reduce friction when accessing external services from the customer portal
Fostering a deep integration between InvoiceCloud and Partners
Revenue Impact
Win deals
AMI (Neptune, Sensus, Itron, My360, Badger EyeOnWater) companies have their own usage portals which can be a blocker for deals
Enable Billers that buy AMI products to integrate them with InvoiceCloud
Billers asking for Reverse SSO
San Jose Water $62k MRR
Padre Dam $11k MRR

Palm Beach County $50-100k MRR
