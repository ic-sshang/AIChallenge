Standup History
Wednesday, August 6th, 2025
 
Troubleshooted ICCryptoService AI HealthCheck issue with key vault secrets
Did not find a solution. Proposed testing GetSecret in the WCF project to validate if it's a preexisting issue at a project level.
Troubleshooting the ICDatabaseService graceful  shutdown issue
I believe Windows shutdown is forcefully closing the applications and ignoring the graceful shutdown. Actively looking for solutions and reached out to PLAT.
SIGTERM, SIGKILL, and SIGINT did not work.
CTRL_SHUTDOWN did not work.
Looking into EQP Controller duplicate emails.
Skybot jobs are failing to be killed, causing duplicate emailing.
Skybot kill job is an internal API leading to no logging or information being readily present.
Will make enhancements to include notice message as part of the response for troubleshooting. (HTML parsing)
Coordinated EQP release with Team SPAM.
Will be doing a rerun with a bileridlist of 1423 and 2401
Team SPAM will be monitoring the EQP runs.
 
Added Details for MI related log failures on confluence.
Started Working on ICCrypto K8 Containerization checklist 1 to document details

Troubleshooting the ICDatabaseService graceful  shutdown issue
SIGTERM, SIGKILL, SIGINT, and CTRL_SHUTDOWN did not work. 
Going to leverage preStop hook to invoke a shutdown and wait for the application to close.
Blocked until platform implements it
Looking into EQP Controller duplicate emails.
EQP Controller kills all jobs regardless whether or not its running.
Reached out to team to confirm issues duplicate email issue is with the skybot jobs.
Prepped for EQP release
Tested ICDatabase K8 alerting through transaction error
Created Shared Service Jira team and set up on-call schedule in preparation for K8 migration

Added Bin files to ICCryptoService and merged as part of IC.Crypto nugetize work
Removing dependencies from IC.Crypto and leveraging DI to prevent dependency mismatch issues.

Tuesday, August 12th, 2025
 
Integrations and platform reached out for help with ICRTDRService
Their IC.Wcf.Helpers had gotten updated to modify host url from ICSERVICES through constructor that is available in nuget version.
Had to revert this since it would require windows service updates ended up implementing a workaround where we have ICSERVICES-K8 host alias pointed at cluster for dependencies and ICSERVICES pointed at 127.0.0.1 for hosting the service.
ICDatabaseService
Graceful shutdown is working but data at end of long running calls 5 minutes or over is not received.
Is there something causing issues in lower environments?
This works in production 
EQP Dupe Email Issue
Reached out and looked into the issue
Skybot job failed to be killed on 7/23 asking Rodlin if the behavior is still going on after package updates.
Will proceed with changes
Performed audit of IC.Slack usage and changes needed
Proposing ChannelIDs added to key vault
At time of migration we will just update ChannelIDs and AuthToken in key vault.
The sooner we make the change the more time devs will have to update it
