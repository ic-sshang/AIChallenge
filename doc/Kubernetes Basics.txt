Overview of Kubernetes
Kubernetes
 is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a robust and flexible framework for running applications in a distributed environment, ensuring high availability, scalability, and resilience.
Key Concepts
Cluster
: A Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of worker machines, called nodes, that run containerized applications. The cluster is managed by a control plane, which coordinates all activities within the cluster.
Node
: A node is a worker machine in Kubernetes, which can be a virtual or physical machine. Each node runs pods and is managed by the control plane.
Pod
: The smallest and simplest Kubernetes object, a pod represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster. Pods can contain one or more containers that share the same network namespace and storage.
Service
: A Kubernetes service is an abstraction that defines a logical set of pods and a policy for accessing them. Services enable communication between different parts of your application and can expose your application to external traffic.
Deployment
: A deployment provides declarative updates to applications. It manages the creation and scaling of pods and ensures that the desired number of pod replicas are running at any given time.
ConfigMap
: A ConfigMap is used to store configuration data in key-value pairs. It allows you to decouple configuration artifacts from image content to keep containerized applications portable.
Secret
: Similar to ConfigMap, a Secret is used to store sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys. Secrets are encoded and can be mounted as files or exposed as environment variables.
Ingress
: An Ingress manages external access to services within a cluster, typically HTTP and HTTPS. It provides load balancing, SSL termination, and name-based virtual hosting.
Kubernetes Architecture
The Kubernetes architecture consists of the following main components:
Control Plane
: The control plane manages the Kubernetes cluster. It consists of several components:
API Server
: The API server is the front end of the Kubernetes control plane. It exposes the Kubernetes API and processes REST operations.
Etcd
: A consistent and highly-available key-value store used as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data.
Controller Manager
: Runs controllers that regulate the state of the cluster, such as the node controller, replication controller, and endpoints controller.
Scheduler
: Assigns pods to nodes based on resource availability and other constraints.
Nodes
: Nodes are the worker machines in a Kubernetes cluster. Each node runs the following components:
Kubelet
: An agent that runs on each node and ensures containers are running in a pod.
Kube-proxy
: A network proxy that runs on each node and maintains network rules for pod communication.
Container Runtime
: The software responsible for running containers, such as Docker or containerd.
Fundamental Components
Namespaces
: Namespaces provide a way to divide cluster resources.
Volumes
: Volumes are used to persist data across pod restarts. 
Labels and Selectors
: Labels are key-value pairs attached to Kubernetes objects, such as pods and services. Selectors are used to identify and group objects based on their labels.
Annotations
: Annotations are key-value pairs used to attach arbitrary non-identifying metadata to objects. They are useful for storing information that can be used by tools and libraries.
ReplicaSets
: A ReplicaSet ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time. It is often used by deployments to maintain the desired state of applications.
StatefulSets
: StatefulSets are used to manage stateful applications. They provide guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of pods, making them suitable for applications that require stable network identities and persistent storage.
