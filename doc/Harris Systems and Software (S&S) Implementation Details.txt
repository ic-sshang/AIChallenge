Test Portals
IC Hosted Test Portal:
Harris - Systems and Software Demo (BID: 327)
Systems and Software Demo (BID: 1534)
Systems and Software Demo 2 (BID: 3363)
Partner Hosted Test Portal: N/A
Biller Test Portal: Required - Systems and Software has requested that each biller have a test portal created along with a prod portal. Systems and Software refer to this as the "Developer Portal".
Rules of Engagement
Always include the S&S Project Manager in all communications. They will route issues accordingly.
Integration Requirements
High level implementation steps (From S&S Product Manager):
InvoiceCloud sets up standard ss_support_acronym and ss_support_acronym_trn portal users
InvoiceCloud provides biller guid
Determine whether we are going to have multi user or single user integration. If multi-user, validate if it will it be unique by email or by username
Determine where the integration will be launched from for the utility users
Determine where Bill Images are coming from
Configuration of BIF/BAF process in enQuesta
Configuration of links to InvoiceCloud from any customer-facing applications in Train, then Prod
Provide endpoints to InvoiceCloud
Ensure that InvoiceCloud can connect
Test all integration functionality
Timeline
~90-120 days 
Configuration
Invoice Types
Beginning with City of Greensboro (BID: 1488) (June 2019), S&S will send over everything as Invoice Type ID 1 unless otherwise specified in sales process.
Virtual Site
Typically do not use our Virtual Site. S&S has a method for one time payers to drop them into Invoice Cloud payment route.

Option Description
Details
74
ENABLE Multiple Customer Login Functionality
If enabled, the Biller will be able to use the Multiple Customer Login functionality in the Biller Portal as well as the Customer Portal. The Pay By Text and Autopay option will also be hidden through the payment route for non-authenticated sessions, and the use of saved method payments through the IVR will be disabled.
Enabled
Only enable this option if the Biller requires multiple registrations per account. 
127
Allow Biller to Change the Email Address for Multiple Linked Accounts
Allow Biller to Change the Email Address for Multiple Linked Accounts If enabled, the biller will be able to update an email address, even if that email address is linked to multiple accounts. This option only applies to billers with the authentication type username with password. This option is Off by default.
This option is 
Off
 by default
It was found that Option 127 needed to be enabled for any new McLogin or conversion to McLogin S&S billers.
108
Disable Email Address Update from BIF
If enabled, invoice file (BIF) imports will not update the customer email address. However, new emails for customers without an email address will still be inserted.
Enable – if required for integration
112
Prevent Update of Empty Account Owner Login Email After Payment
Note: 
Enable this when using Allow CC Email Updates, Prevent Email Update, and Allow Unregistered Updates.
Enable - required if Option 131 is enabled
131
Update Email Address After Payment
By default, we would allow the owner’s email addresses to be updated in the payment route if the owner’s email address is empty (
Allow email updates
).
Allow CC email updates:
 Update the CC email address when a different email is entered during the payment route. (Never update the main email address).
Prevent email updates:
 Prevent owner and CC email addresses from being overridden.
Allow unregistered updates:
 will update every time the customer is not registered.
The default value for this Option is: 
"Allow email updates"
Select appropriate action
134
Send email(s) to the payer's email address only. For the Virtual Site only.
When this option is enabled, emails will only be sent to the payer's email address (email entered in the payment route).
Enable – if required for integration

Data Pump Logic
/Cutoff Times
Partner
Upon Request after kick off call
Each night, S&S billers perform "system maintenance", which includes taking a backup of their entire enQuesta system. During this time, the S&S web services (RTDR and DataPump) are both unavailable. To mitigate any payment posting issues, we hardcode a window of time per biller (Cutoff Time), that we will not send transactions through the DataPump or RTDR. Once the window is over we will begin sending transactions again. This will need to be asked by the Invoice Cloud Implementations Project Manager during Implementation and sent to Invoice Cloud Engineering with the Coding information.
When we post payments through the DataPump, we also send the batch date. Depending on the timing, we will add days as necessary, so the posting date is based on the next business day(s). Upon batch close, we will add an additional day to transactions being posted, so they show in a separate batch in enQuesta (CIS). Most S&S billers have specific batch numbers, tender types, and dates to add logic for the DataPump. Please consult Implementation project files for specifics on each biller.
See below for a prior S&S Project’s cutoff times and DataPump logic. In the below, 11:55 is the cutoff window.

Tender Types
Partner or Biller
Upon Request after kick off call
Request Tender Types. Tender Types vary per Biller. 
Tender Types are a method for S&S Billers to track granular payment details in the Enquesta CIS system.  Each payment sent via DataPump must contain a tender type for the payment to be consumed by Enquesta.
Payment Source IDs in Invoice Cloud are translated to Tender Types which the Biller and S&S have already created in Enquesta.  Please note that Tender Types can also have detail setup for both Credit Card, EFT/ACH and OBD.  These values also assist the Enquesta reconciliation reporting for the biller and their financial accounting staff. If Invoice Cloud needs to walk the Biller through these values, it is best to start buy explaining and showing the biller the Search > Payments report and noting the various Payment Source IDs that Invoice Cloud can track per payment.  
Please note that Invoice Cloud cannot add new Payment Source IDs, but additional Tender Types can be added in Enquesta to capture the detail of Payment Source ID + Payment Type (CC, EFT/ACH, OBD, etc.).  If this biller is new to S&S Enquesta, then S&S must be involved in these conversations to configure their side of the DataPump for Tender Types.
Invoice Cloud must receive Tender Types from the Biller or Sy&S prior to coding submission. These will be tested by Invoice Cloud in the DataPump before coding is completed. The Invoice Cloud Implementations Project Manager should work with Invoice Cloud Engineering, the Biller, and S&S on the testing results. 
Example of Tender Types: 
Operator Numbers
Partner
Upon Request after kick off call
Operator numbers allow for the payment batch controls in S&S Enquesta CIS to accept all Invoice Cloud payments into one common grouping.  This value helps drive reconciliation reporting in Enquesta. The Invoice Cloud Implementations Project Manager should work with S&S and the Biller to obtain this value. Typically Invoice Cloud will receive a value for TEST and PROD; these will not change and will only be set once in coding.
The Invoice Cloud Implementations Project Manager should work with Invoice Cloud Engineering, the Biller, and S&S for testing results.
Examples of Operator Numbers: 
Batch ID
Upon Request after kick off call
All Invoice Cloud payments will be entered into specific Batch values. This helps drive automation and reconciliation reporting in S&S Enquesta; Invoice Cloud sends a Batch ID with every payment in the DataPump. Since this is sent for each DataPump payment transaction, this value is required for our coding efforts.
The Invoice Cloud Implementations Project Manager should work with S&S and the Biller to obtain this value.  The Invoice Cloud Implementations Project Manager should work with Invoice Cloud Engineering, the Biller, and S&S for testing results.
