Rate limiting rules
Determine our baseline and apply rate limiting, we can exclude URI paths such as /api/*
You have the ability to apply actions such as requiring connections from one IP over the allowed limit to receive a captcha prompt instead of just dropping them
Caching
We have the following issues with caching
We set a cookie header on:  /images/loginpointer.png causing it to not be cached, do we need a cookie header on this image?
We are missing a significant amount of caches due to our session ID being in the url.  Cloudflare does not have a solution for this
