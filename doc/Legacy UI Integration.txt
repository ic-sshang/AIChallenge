Proposal 1 - Separate 1.5 Application Host (Accepted)
A new .Net MVC application will be created to serve and host the new React 1.5 UI pages.  This application will be hosted in K8s and need HTTP routing to the cluster.   MyIIS will redirect to the 1.5 application using its fully qualified URL for any new 1.5 React SPA views/virtual pages.   Dev environment routing UI HTTP traffic to the cluster is done by a sub-domain, 
https://payer-ui-v2.dev.invoicecloud.com/payer/pyrprtl0/home/index/paybytext
.  A upstream routing component (Barracuda WAF) that supports path based routing will be used to intercept and route UI HTTP traffic to the new application in the cluster using the legacy application sub-domain and a virtual path, 
https://www.invoicecloud.com/portal/ui/home/index/{sessionId}/paybytext
.
1.5 React UI Asset Hosting Topology
The HTML page, React JavaScript files, CSS files, image files will be served from k8s applications.
Proposal 2 - MyIIS Page Host (Rejected)
A new MyIIS ASPX WebForm shell page will be created to host the new React 1.5 UI scripts.  The React scripts and static assets will be hosted in K8s.   MyIIS will navigate to its 1.5 ASPX page for any new 1.5 React SPA views/virtual pages.  The shell ASPX page served from MyIIS and will be in the same domain as MyIIS.  The MyIIS shell page will pull scripts from the new UI sub-domain which is routed to the k8s cluster.
1.5 React UI Asset Hosting Topology
The HTML page will be served from the MyIIS application.  React JavaScript files, CSS files, image files will be served from k8s applications.
