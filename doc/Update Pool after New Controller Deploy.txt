Navigate to the pools tab in the BatchAccount (in this example: icbatchtest). Locate the controller pool, 
OBDControllerPool
Under the Application Packages tab, update the version of the application to the latest that is available, and click save. 
Next navigate to the Nodes tab and right-click on the node that should be idle. Reboot the node to make sure the application package is deployed to the node. A dialog will appear you can select either of the choices, unless there is something running you don’t have to worry about rebooting under any of the choices.
