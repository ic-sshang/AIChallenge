Testing
 to validate the following Test Cases:
Access blocked from Laptop due to not allowing access from the WARP IPs. 
Access allowed from Prod AVD in the Prod Network but in a Spoke VNet that does not yet have the Azure SQL Server Private DNS Zone linked therefore traffic still uses Azure Resource Connection Exception. 
Access allowed from Prod Jumpbox in the Prod Newtork attached to a Subnet in the Prod Hub that does have the Azure SQL Server Private DNS Zone linked and Azure SQL Server Private Endpoint added therefore traffic uses the Private Endpoint.
