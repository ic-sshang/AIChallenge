1
Welcome Text
Enter text that will be visible to the payers. 
The welcome text is what a payer will see that has the biller’s info and items they offer for payment online. This can include service fees, and the IVR phone number. 
2
Virtual Site Settings
Use New Site Setting to add Invoice Types.
Invoice types that need to have a button on the virtual site will need to be added in this step. This is for the EBPP invoice types.

3
Virtual Site Setting Groups
If applicable: Universal Invoice Search (aka Global Search) - Setup - Select New Virtual Site Group and add Invoice Types
The invoice group will display on the virtual site landing page just as if it’s a single invoice type, even though behind the scenes, there are multiple invoice types configured for it. The Invoice Type inputs and outputs still need to be configured for Universal Search.
4
Cloud Store Items
Use New Item to add Cloud Store Invoice Types. 
Cloud Store Invoice Types are added and then configured in this section. The Cloud Store can be either biller facing or customer facing (with a button on the virtual site).  Ensure each Cloud Store Label is pointed to the correct Invoice Type.
5
Virtual Site Menu Items
Verify that appropriate Invoice Types are listed as virtual site menu items. These are automatically created when Virtual Site Settings are added. This area you can rearrange the order of the buttons on the Virtual Site.
All Invoice Types that show on the Virtual Site will be in this section. The Items can be dragged and moved to rearrange the order of the buttons. This is also where menu groups are created to help organize a Virtual Site with many items (buttons).
 
6
Other Virtual Site Tabs
Edit Biller required changes to Custom Messages, Customer Portal Grids, Customizable Text, and Payment Methods tabs.
If custom messages, customer portal grids, customizable text or payment methods need to be reflected differently to meet the Biller’s specifications, you will need to edit these tabs under the Virtual Site.
 
QC Summary Delivery
Virtual Site QC uses the BOF, the Biller and Internal Questionnaires (found in Smartsheet), the CRM, and access of the Virtual Site and Biller Portal for the Biller. Virtual Site QC is requested by the Implementation Manager or the Project Manger typically two weeks before Go-Live.

Why is there more than one button for a single invoice type
Sometimes when a new Virtual Site Setting is saved, duplicate Virtual Site Menu Items are added.
You will need to submit a Data Services ticket to have these extra records purged.
