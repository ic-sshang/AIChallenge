Create Invoice Record via Web Service.
MyIIS → Virtual Site → Customer Portal → Register Account via Invoice. (Refer to 
Guru Card
 for this item)
QDS Inquiry - Invoice Data Look up
QDS has custom logic in the Virtual Site to create invoices for customers. When a customer wants to pay for their invoice in the IC Virtual Site, they are first taken to the QDS page using the biller’s TownName (ex: 
https://www.mytaxbill.org/inet/bill/home.do?town=ansonia
 ). 
Once they look up their invoice, IC then pulls the QDS Invoice Data from their QDS’s servers using the URL Request (url = https://{
QDSDomainName
}/inet/revenue/seamlessBill.do?town={
QDSTownName
.ToLower}&byear={
Year
}&btype={
Type
}&bnumber={
BillNumber
}) and creates a single invoice record using our web service Cloud Invoicing → UploadInvoice. 
Note
: If the customer wants to, they can also register their account with InvoiceCloud when they want to pay for their  invoice and keep track of it. (Refer to 
Guru Card
 for this item)

 Apply Fee to Installment 1 For that Bill Year (Please update with advanced setting that is used)
Used by: 
BID - 3328
 (Colchester)
For the standard integration the ‘FeeDue' and 'Lien’ and InstallmentAmount2 are added to the latest / most current installment. For Motor Vehicle and Personal Property, This biller would like these fields fee to always be added to installment 1 of that bill year. In RTDR check for where ‘FeeDue’ is being added and always add it to the first installment for that year.
Additionally, the balance for installment2 (bill-2) should always be set to 0.
Used by: BID - 730 (East Providence Only)
IC stored procedure designed to retrieve installments linked to a biller invoice. However, this SP does not order the results by installment number, so we have a mismatch balance between the QDS inquiry page and InvoiceCloud.
Update our SP ‘spQdsFindOtherInquiryInvoices' to include an additional column field 'billerinstallmentNumber’ to be able to order by it, so that the logic outside of the SP is looping by the installment numbers in an ascending order. In addition, we can check if there is unpaid balance in any installments that past the due date.
Real Time Data Refresh
PullQdsData
Before any QDS RTDR happens, there is a check if 
Option 46
 is turned on. Option is usually turned on by IM. 
This options keeps auto-conveyance on during real time data refresh JSON calls and keeps outstanding bills with the new owner.

User Experience Integration
This section documents the initial, recommended user experience design for this integration. Since user experience integration uses Invoice Cloud web services that are available to a Biller, it’s possible for the Biller to change at any time without notifying Invoice Cloud after Go-Live how they use our web services.

File Mapping
Invoice File
File Summary/Purpose: The purpose of this file is to transfer bill/invoice data to IC from the biller. Invoice Cloud imports one file with multiple invoice types based on the Bill Type seen in the file mapping below. 
Updates at 07/03/2024
For Biller Town of Needham only, 6 → If Biller Advanced Setting 39 is set to TRUE, then the AccountNumber is equal to
 
“WS-" & BillType & AccountID
AccountID = IC FileSpecID 42- Custom5: UniqueID
File Extension: .txt
File Naming Convention: 
File Delimiter: NA - Fixed position
Specification: Unknown
Sample File: 
SFTP File Path: “D:\inetpub\ftproot\qds\” & “TownCode999” - ex. BID-2896, Invoice Files to IC File Path is set to “D:\inetpub\ftproot\qds\TownCode002\ToInvoiceCloud\InvoiceFiles” (Note: Please review 
Quality Data Systems (QDS) Implementation Details
  to set the TownCode folder to the SFTP File Path.) QDS loads the BIF in the qds FTP to the specific town code folder.
File Transfer Frequency:  All day
Note: This file documentation is for the latest QDS setup we use for all generic QDS billers. These values in the Invoice file are coming from the invoice file type “QDS Comprehensive File Type”
