What are the items that can be deployed during the day?
Batch Processes and Skybot jobs that run in the middle of the night (need to consider the volume and if it is helpful to deploy during the day or night)
Frequent jobs that are not long running (Some email queue type, not our main high volume ones)
Brand new stored procs
NuGet Package Feed (already doing these during the day)
ICServices with built in hot swap
Anything that runs in a container (more coming from Next Gen team)
Exclusions: All Web Apps, the expectation is that they are always up
Release Candidate Questions and Matrix:
For each of the above, we need to understand the risk exposure, prod testing, monitoring, and rollback need to be considered for each of these.
How fast can we identify that we introduced an issue in prod (what monitoring/alerting is in place)?
How fast can we remediate a problem that does get introduced in prod during the day and what is the rollback plan (service, data, configs)?
What are we doing to feel comfortable deploying during the day?
Are there dependencies of other applications?
How do we define Risk?
Production biller/consumer impact
Matrix:

Example of a Day Time Deployment
Skybot Batch Close Job ACH auto close
Repo level approval > Rob approves > TL Approves and deploys
Validation > review the skybot logs after the run of the job >verifying the pipeline deployed the right artifact
Approval Process?
Does this need to be different than after hour deployments?
How do we manage this at a fix version level?
