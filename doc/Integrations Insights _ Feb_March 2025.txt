YTD Insights
Since the beginning of the year, a total of 217 tickets have been reported in the integration space, highlighting various issues across different services:
https://invoicecloud.atlassian.net/jira/dashboards/10393?maximized=17890
Bill Presentment
 is the most frequently reported service, with 67 tickets. Among these, 
17 tickets
 are related to 
PDF Extraction
, accounting for 
24%
 of all Bill Presentment issues. This high percentage indicates that PDF Extraction is a critical area within Bill Presentment that requires attention.

Proposed Solution:
 PDF Marker Management and reprocessing tool
Real-Time Mouse Position on PDF X and Y Axis
: Implement a tool that allows CS to view the real-time mouse position on the PDF X and Y axis. This feature will help CS accurately identify the location of failing markers and make necessary adjustments.
Processing and Renaming Tool
: Develop a tool that enables CS to process and rename PDFs efficiently via the CRM.
Bursting Tool
: Consider implementing a bursting tool that can split large PDF files into smaller, manageable segments. 
Display Last Linked PDF Per Template: 
Make the latest PDF that was processed and linked correctly for each specific template readily available.
Implement a PDF Size Limit for Processing: 
Establishing a size limit for PDFs that can be accepted and processed. PDFs exceeding this size limit will be automatically rejected to prevent processing issues.
Monthly Insights
In February, a total of 60 integration-related tickets were resolved. Of these, 20 were specifically related to file processing:
https://invoicecloud.atlassian.net/jira/dashboards/10393?maximized=17894
Among these 20 tickets, 
7 tickets
 can be categorized as File Upload failures due to missing data, duplicate files, or incorrect data. These tickets account for
 33%
 of the resolved File Processing tickets for the month. They were categorized under mitigation actions such as Additional Information, Manual Generation, and Invalid Biller Input. This highlights the need for improved error messaging and dashboard functionality to help billers identify and correct issues independently, reducing the reliance on support intervention.
Proposed Solution: 
Data Quality & Logging Enhancements
Enhance the File Processing Dashboard
: Expand the dashboard to include more specific and detailed error messages, enabling billers to quickly identify and resolve issues independently.

Final Thoughts
After reviewing tickets and sharing perspectives, the team has identified three support tooling opportunities. These tools are intended for use by CS and Billers to identify and address issues with file or PDF processing.
The overarching strategy is to develop prototypes that transition certain engineering tasks from engineering toil to CS toil, and eventually to Biller self-service. The goal is to increase both teams' bandwidth for more impactful work. These projects are still in the ideation stage and require alignment with the Integrations team. 
Shared Goals:
Develop self-service tools for CS and Billers.
Increase working capacity for both teams by reducing toil.
Reduce bugs.
Product Reliability needs:
Mechanism for release and deployment of tools.
Assistance with testing and code review.
Reduce/eliminated recurring issues.
Integrations needs:
