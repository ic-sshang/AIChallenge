Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation.  Azure Kubernetes Service (aks) will be used as a managed Kubernetes cloud service.
The platform will be used to manage various workloads; HTTP APIs, HTTP UIs, scheduled jobs, auto scale jobs, and TCP services.
