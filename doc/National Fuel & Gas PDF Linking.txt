The NFG PDF linking process requires 2 files in order to be manually processed:
a Bill File, provided by NFG (typically named BILLYYYYMMDD.txt)
an Index File, provided by print vendor Matrix (typically named NFG-YYYYMMDD.dat)
Since the files are uploaded via FTP, they will usually be inside of a zipped file (.ZIP), this is key to note for the following steps if it is necessarry to locate the file in our servers.
If these files have been uploaded before via the standard production file import/upload process the Biller is set up for, they can be found in the file backups across various servers. 
To find where the files are located, query the following on the Biller sharded database (shard2613):
For Bill file: 
SELECT * FROM BillerFileUploadV2 WHERE FileName = 'BILLYYYYMMDD.txt' ORDER BY 1 DESC
For Index file: 
SELECT * FROM BillerFileUploadV2 WHERE FileName = 'NFG-YYYYMMDD.ZIP' ORDER BY 1 DESC
The “Machine“ column in the resulting rows will be the server where the files can be found.
Once the files are retrieved, the repository for the application needed to be ran will need to be cloned. Using Visual Studio in the Bastion servers, clone & open the BillerPDFRemoteLinkingReferenceProcessing project. Verify the project is running on the “main“ branch, no other changes need to be made to the project.
Steps to linked PDFs:
Place the index file in 
icftproot\MatrixPrinter\ToInvoiceCloud\2613
Placed the Bill file in 
icftproot\MatrixPrinter\ToInvoiceCloud\2613\Bill
Run BillerPDFRemoteLinkingReferenceProcessing project locally to link the invoices.
Once application is done running, use the database to confirm the invoice records uploaded on the day in question contain a PdfToken and PdfFilename. 
Once confirmed, use the BillerPortal to verify the PDFs are viewable for the invoices and the data on the PDFs are correct and pertain to the correct customer.
