To remove a Remote State Resource, first you need to prep the Repo locally by adding the 
organization
 and 
workspace
to the 
cloud{}
 block as demonstrated below:
terraform {
  cloud {
    organization = "InoviceCloud"

    workspaces {
      name = "avd-workspace-pri-eus-npd-1"
    }
  }

  required_providers {
    azurerm = "~> 3.112.0"
    azapi = {
      source  = "azure/azapi"
      version = "1.13.1"
    }
  }
}
Then run the following commands to log into the Terrasform Cloud Organization and initialize the repo against the Workspace Remote State:
terraform login

terraform init
Finally run the Remove Remote State Resource command as demonstrated below:
terraform state rm 'azapi_resource_action.vm_start["avd-Rannem1"]'
