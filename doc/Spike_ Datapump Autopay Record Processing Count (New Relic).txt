Goal
Provide a quick way to visualize the number of Autopay transactions processed by Datapump, broken down by 
BillerID
, with:
A 
pie chart
 showing distribution across selected billers.
A 
line chart
 (timeseries) showing trend over time, per BillerID.
A 
dashboard dropdown
 to filter by specific BillerID(s) and a control for how many billers to show in the pie.

Data Source
New Relic Event:
 
AutoPaymentTransactions
Key attribute:
 
BillerID
 (facet)
Window:
 last 
2 months
 (adjustable)
NRQL Queries
Replace 
{COUNT}
 with the number of top billers to display (e.g., 5, 10). The dashboard filter will further narrow results by 
BillerID
.
Pie Chart — Distribution by BillerID (last 2 months)
wide
760
SELECT count(*) AS 'Auto Pay Transactions'
FROM AutoPaymentTransactions
FACET BillerID
SINCE 2 months ago
LIMIT {COUNT}

Chart type:
 Pie
Notes:
 Use the dashboard filter (BillerID) to focus on specific billers; the pie will re-aggregate accordingly.
Line Chart — Trend by BillerID (last 2 months)
wide
760
SELECT count(*) AS 'Auto Pay Transactions'
FROM AutoPaymentTransactions
FACET BillerID
SINCE 2 months ago
TIMESERIES AUTO
LIMIT {COUNT}

Chart type:
 Line (Timeseries)
Notes:
 
TIMESERIES AUTO
 lets NR choose a sensible interval; adjust (e.g., 
TIMESERIES 1 day
) if you need coarser granularity.

Dashboard Setup Steps (New Relic)
Create dashboard
 → 
Add a new dashboard
 → Name: 
Datapump • Autopay Processing
.
Add filter
 (top-right 
Filters
 → 
Add filter
):
Attribute:
 
BillerID
Operator:
 
equals / in list
Display:
 
Dropdown
 (multi-select)
Add variable
 (optional) to control 
{COUNT}
:
If using New Relic dashboard variables, create a 
Text/Number variable
 named 
count
 and reference it in NRQL-enabled widgets that support variables. If variables aren’t available in your NR account, set a static 
LIMIT
 (e.g., 10) and document it.
Add widgets:
Pie chart widget
 with the first query; title: 
Autopay Transactions by BillerID (Pie)
.
Line chart widget
 with the second query; title: 
Autopay Transactions by BillerID (Trend)
.
Time picker:
 Set dashboard time to 
Last 2 months
 (override allowed by viewer).
Interaction Model
Biller filter (dropdown):
 Users select one or more 
BillerID
s to focus the view. Both widgets respect the filter.
Pie count control:
 
{COUNT}
 determines how many billers appear as slices (top-N by volume). If a dashboard variable isn’t available, create alternate widgets for common N values (e.g., 5, 10, 15).
Validation Checklist
Queries return data within the last 2 months.
BillerID
 shows as facet in both widgets.
Dashboard-level 
BillerID
 filter narrows both widgets.
Pie shows top 
{COUNT}
 billers; line chart shows same set.
