Below is a list of Pod Security Baseline Policies we recommend for all Kubernetes Clusters Deployed within the InvoiceCloud infrastructure, note exceptions can be made and Risks can be Accepted based on the nature of the Workloads to be hosted in the Kubernetes Cluster.

The Kubernetes Cluster Control Plane API Should not be Associated with any Public IPs
The Kubernetes Control Plane is one of the main attack vectors of a Kubernetes Cluster, and if exploited can allow an Attacker to access Pods within the Cluster, deploy their Own Pods onto the Cluster that can be used to snoop on data transiting thru the Cluster, or even deploy their Own Pods onto the Cluster for Crypto Mining activities, hijacking someone else Compute for their own gain.
No Kubernetes Cluster at InvoiceCloud should allow the Control Plane API to be directly associated with a Public IP address that allows access to actors outside the InvoiceCloud Network.
Example
Using Private Endpoints in Azure for an AKS Cluster to remove the usage of Public IPs for the Control Plane of the AKS Cluster.

User Access to the Control Plane Should Be Limited and Appropriate Roles Defined and Assigned
 The Kubernetes Control Plane is one of the main attack vectors of a Kubernetes Cluster, and if exploited can allow an Attacker to access Pods within the Cluster, deploy their Own Pods onto the Cluster that can be used to snoop on data transiting thru the Cluster, or even deploy their Own Pods onto the Cluster for Crypto Mining activities, hijacking someone else Compute for their own gain.
Access to the Kubernetes Cluster’s Control Control Plane should be limited to only those who have a need to access the Cluster.  Access should also be modeled to allow for Least Privileged access patterns, i.e. not everyone who has access to the Cluster should be assigned a Cluster Admin Role.
Access should be granted in a way that allows for easy audit of who has access to the Cluster so access reviews can be done on a periodic basis and those who no longer have a need to access the Cluster can have there access revoked.
 
Example
Create Azure Active Directory (AAD) Groups to use for Cluster Access, one set of AAD Groups per Cluster comprised of a Admin Group, User Group, and Reader Group.

None
A Security Monitoring Tool Should be Deployed to the Cluster
A security monitoring tool should be deployed to the Cluster to evaluate cluster configurations, acquire security recommendations, conduct vulnerability scans, and receive real-time protection/alerts, thereby ensuring a robust defense against potential threats.
Example
Deploy the CrowdStrike Kubernetes Protection set of Solutions for Container and Cluster security.
