Process Workflow
The process starts when the executable is launched.  It will configure itself to search the directory specified in the 
IC_APPDATA_DIR 
environment variable inside of the 
ICGBoardingFiles 
folder.  For example if the IC_APPDATA_DIR is set to
 
\\file-server\share1
, then the application will search the directory 
\\file-server\share1\ICGBoardingFile.
ProgramManager
ProgramManager
After the path has been configured the application immediately invokes the 
ProgramManager
 calling the 
ProcessFiles
 method passing in the directory constructed eariler.  Once started the process looks for files in this directory.  If it finds no files it will report “No files to processs…” and exit.  However, if files are found it will look at the file name.  If the lower-cased file name starts with “ic” then it will invoke the 
ICBoardingFileProcessor
.  If the lower-cased file name starts with “psn” it will invoke the 
PSNBoardingFileProcessor
.  In the event the file name doesn’t start with either “psn” or “ic” the process will error with the message “Invalid Filename”.
