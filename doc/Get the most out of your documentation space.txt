Get the most out of your documentation space
Labels are key words that you can add to pages and attachments to make them easier to group and find. For example, you could add the 
recruiting
 label to all pages related to finding and hiring new talent. That would allow you to easily see, display, and search for related pages.
Anyone with permission to edit a page can add labels to it. You can add labels to a page while youre editing it or after its published, when youre viewing the page.
You can also insert a list of different labels to make it easy for people to find important pages. Choose from:
Popular labels: a list of the most popular labels in your space
Labels list: list all labels in your space in alphabetical order
Content by label: list all pages tagged with a specific label
