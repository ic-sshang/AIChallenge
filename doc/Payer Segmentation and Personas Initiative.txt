The Problem
We currently lack understanding of who our payer’s are, what they do and why when making payments or interacting with our products. 
Areas for exploring for segmentation: 
Search results drop off 
Confirmation Review drop off
Submitter/ non submitter pricing
Why: How do we know this is a real problem and worth solving?
Developing payer personas will help us understand our payers, better identify pain points, and opportunity areas. 
(In Progress) Brainstorm of possible personas we could find: 
older vs. younger payers
individual vs. business payers 
payer types by region
continuous past due payers
autopay/RSP/ “Always on time” Payers 
delinquent payers 
payers by vertical (GUB, Financial, Insurance, Tax, CloudStore Services?)
payers by payment source (online payments, IVR, in person, CSRs, CloudStore)
counting invoices by balance forward 
Audience: Who are we building for? 
Internal use. 
High-level Approach/Resources 
Varied quantitative and qualitative approach to gathering user information. First steps is to gather user behavior data around hypothesized segments, starting with regional, payment source, and vertical. These are the top three hypothesized areas we could see segmentation of users show. From findings there we will overlay demographic data. A second phase once initial segments are found is layering this information with user research data from on-site surveys, support calls/cases. Actions/Resources to get user information:
Analytics
GA demographics 
regional/age/ gender demographics 
UX Research 
surveys via Pendo/Appcues
UX Research Quarterly
Interviews
internal - internal brainstorm/ subject matter experts 
external - external payer interviews 
internal payer support calls, support tickets
Solutioning Steps 
As mentioned above payers will first try to be segmented by key assumed data points where we believe we will see differentiating trends. These data points are regional, biller vertical, possibly individual vs. business, payment source and new payers. Some of these assumed data points are outlined below assumed personas we want to specifically research payer trends in. 
Research Progress on Personas / Cohorts
Have / Questions:
CRM > Invoice Analysis > Location Analysis. Paid Invoice Count omits balance forward. (Shows State by invoice type count) All Billers. Dates pulled are April 2021- April 2022. 
CRM > Invoice Analysis > All Billers. Paid Invoice Count omits balance forward. (Shows invoice count, invoice paid count, invoice paid % ) All billers.  Dates pulled are April 2021- April 2022.
CRM > Payments by source. Payment type is not Balance Forward. (Shows Payment count and payment volume by payment source group) what is the difference in live agent payment and in person payment? All billers. Dates pulled are Jan 01 2021 to April 2022.
Need Request for verticals. Verticals differ in SF and DB division.
CRM > Payments by source. What is the definition, difference of live agent payment vs in person payment? 
CRM > Payments by source. Invoices, confirming invoices is open, standing, not created?
Confirmed Paid invoices excludes balance forward. 
ITR 19784 to gather biller balance forward, and past due invoices. 
ITR 19798 to gather EBPP specific payment source data 
Reporting - payment adoption rates, can’t download this?
Reporting - monthly invoice comparison - invoices paid, created, etc? 
New Payers - Biller Recent go live 
Data Requests: gather new registration, new payer data off recent go lives. New Payer Analysis. looking for base line data on new registrations vs. imports
GA: consistently ~40% of session traffic is new payers (keep in mind that Google cookie tracking lasts  60 days)
UX Research: first time payers research? does marketing have any material/ feedback we give on this? 
Support Cases: # payer support cases since a go live, and in what area?

Success and Outcome 
Personas listed including 
Who are they? 
What are their goals? 
What are their tasks?
What the barriers preventing them from achieving their goals?
Should include information of the following of payer personas/segments: 
new payers - what its the “new payer” metrics/ actions baseline? 
Biller’s and vertical’s payer make up. We should have overall understanding of a biller/ vertical’s typically payer persona. 
New Payers - Biller Recent go live 
Payers by Vertical
Past Due Payers 
Questions
Analytics
GA demographics 
Power BI 
Do we have a way to separate payers from individual and businesses? Maybe we could assume by linked account over X amount (covering landlords possibly?)? 
regional/age/gender demographics to gather from GA for demographics
UX Research 
surveys via Pendo/Appcues
To Research- “why are you on the site today?” more to come. 
UX Research Quarterly
Could we use Appcues/Pendo to trigger T&C signing for the quarterly benchmarking survey? 
Can/should we expand the timeline on the open ended CRM feedback to get more feedback? How are we picking what week to run that each quarter?
Interviews
internal - internal brainstorm/ subject matter experts 
external - external payer interviews 
internal payer support calls, support tickets
