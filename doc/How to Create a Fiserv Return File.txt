Please follow this guide to create a return file: 
https://dev.azure.com/invoicecloud/Src/_git/MC_RPPS?path=/MC_RPPS/CreateReturnFileFiserv.vb
.
If the file is created and will be placed in the directory to be picked up the next day’s run, you will need to update all the dates in the file to tomorrow’s date. 
Path: \\10.0.6.4\Data\AppData\RPPS\out\fiserv
The filename will be ECX.PROD.EXBINCL1.INPUT@prd1dynamic.int.xfrp
*It will be overridden when the new one gets created during the run. It seems like sending it through Filezilla is best.
If the file is created and will be sent through Filezilla, you will need to update all the dates in the file to today’s date. For Filezilla, you will need the Hostname, Fiserv Username, and Fiserv Password, and the upload will be in the inbox folder.
