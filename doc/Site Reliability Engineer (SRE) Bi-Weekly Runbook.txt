Commit to sprint tasks and estimate effort for assigned items.
Review Open Incidents & Technical Debt:
Identify unresolved 
P1/P2 incidents
 and prioritize their resolution.
Document any 
recurring issues
 that need long-term fixes.
Plan Proactive Monitoring Enhancements:
Determine if 
New Relic alerts, synthetic tests, or dashboards
 need improvement.
Tuesday: Performance Analysis & System Optimization
Objective:
 Focus on system performance improvements and ensure the application runs efficiently.
Tasks:
Analyze Performance Trends in New Relic:
Identify slow transactions, 
memory leaks, high CPU usage, and database bottlenecks
.
Investigate potential 
service degradations
 before they impact users.
Work on Sprint Items Related to Performance & Observability:
Optimize 
APM instrumentation
 and logging strategies.
Fine-tune 
alerts and thresholds
 to reduce false positives.
Capacity Planning & Scaling Checks:
Review 
auto-scaling configurations
 for anticipated load increases.
Wednesday: Incident Review & Automation Enhancements
Objective:
 Conduct a deeper analysis of past incidents and automate repetitive tasks.
Tasks:
Incident Review Meeting (if applicable):
Discuss major incidents from the past sprint.
Conduct a 
Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
 and update documentation.
Determine 
preventive actions
 to avoid recurrence.
Automate Repetitive Manual Tasks:
Identify areas where automation can 
reduce toil
 (e.g., auto-healing scripts, and log analysis tools).
Work on automating 
runbook steps, monitoring improvements, or self-healing mechanisms
.
Update Confluence Documentation:
Improve 
troubleshooting guides, incident playbooks, and system architecture diagrams
.
Thursday: Knowledge Sharing & Documentation
Objective:
 Improve team knowledge and collaboration.
Tasks:
Internal Knowledge Sharing Session:
Share 
lessons learned from incidents, performance optimizations, and monitoring improvements
.
Encourage team members to contribute 
queries, scripts, and debugging techniques
.
Update Troubleshooting & Runbooks:
Improve 
standard operating procedures (SOPs)
 for issue resolution.
Ensure 
on-call documentation
 is up to date.
Friday: Mid-Sprint Checkpoint & On-Call Readiness
Objective:
 Ensure the sprint is on track and prepare for on-call responsibilities.
Tasks:
Mid-Sprint Review:
Assess sprint progress and 
identify blockers
.
Adjust 
priorities
 if necessary based on new incidents.
Prepare for On-Call Handoff (if applicable):
Verify 
alert policies, escalation procedures, and incident response guidelines
 are up to date.
Ensure the on-call engineer is 
briefed on ongoing issues and areas of concern
.
Week 2: Closing the Sprint & Continuous Improvement
Monday: Stability & Capacity Review
Objective:
 Review system stability and ensure adequate resources are available.
Tasks:
Review System Load & Scaling Metrics:
Ensure optimal 
scaling configurations
 for peak and off-peak hours.
Check for Stability Issues from Last Week:
Validate that recent 
fixes and optimizations
 are working as expected.
Tuesday: Finalizing Sprint Tasks & Addressing Open Issues
Objective:
 Ensure all committed sprint tasks are nearing completion.
Tasks:
Finish & Validate Sprint Items:
Ensure all 
observability improvements, performance fixes, and automation tasks
 are completed.
Triage Any Remaining Issues:
Identify any 
carryover work
 for the next sprint.
Wednesday: Sprint Review Preparation & Post-Mortems
Objective:
 Prepare for the Sprint Review by summarizing completed work.
Tasks:
Conduct Post-Mortems on Major Incidents:
Document 
root causes, resolutions, and preventive actions
.
Update 
monitoring configurations
 if necessary.
Prepare Sprint Review Slides or Reports:
Highlight 
performance optimizations, reliability improvements, and key findings
.
Thursday: Sprint Review & Knowledge Sharing
Objective:
 Showcase sprint accomplishments and share knowledge.
Tasks:
Sprint Review Meeting:
Present 
SRE-related improvements
 (e.g., better monitoring, automation, performance gains).
Demonstrate how 
system reliability has improved
.
Internal Knowledge Sharing:
Conduct a 
short training session
 or 
discussion
 on a relevant SRE topic.
Friday: Sprint Retrospective & Next Sprint Prep
Objective:
 Reflect on the sprint and set the stage for the next one.
Tasks:
Sprint Retrospective Meeting:
Discuss 
what went well, what didn’t, and improvement opportunities
.
Identify 
process changes to improve future sprints
.
Plan for the Next Sprint:
Review 
technical debt, incident trends, and monitoring gaps
 to propose sprint items.
