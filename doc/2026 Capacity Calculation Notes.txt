Current US Team’s Sprint Capacity is 28 Points, so in context of US Platform Team:
1 dot = 28 points
2 dots = 56 points
3 dots = 112 points
4 dots = 168 points
5 dots = 336 points
 
 please come up with estimated Velocities per Sprint in 2026 for the JEDI and FOTPs so we can have some context when we review the dots next time and also we should ensure we have Assignees on each Idea to signify which Platform Team is initially expected to do the work so we can T-Shirt Size based on the specific Team’s capacity and ensure one team is not drastically over or under committed.  Thanks!
3 Teams, each Team has capacity for between 10 and 16 T-Shirt Size Dots.
3 x 16 dots would get max capacity of 
48
 dots.
Current Items for Time Horizon of 2026 within the Regulatory and Non-Discretionary Layer Cakes is 
47
 dots, 
which does not account for INFRA Items or Application Dependency Requests.
 
 
 we have not had any App Teams reach out to us to let us know they have dependencies on work from the Platform Team in 2026.  How are we planning to manage that Depedency Discovery, Planning, and on-going Management?
