FTP
BS&A calls the invoice file a Bill Export File. IC always sets up SFTP tasks to pickup TXT files or zipped files. 
IM’s provide these instructions to the biller after the kick-off call on how to export files from BS&A -
Utility:
Tax:
Adjustment/Balances
BS&A Real-Time Lookup (RTL) web services
RTDR
Data refresh does not work until after go-live
If client uploads adjustment files then balance on account is incorrect. See JitBit ticket #54507 for more info and to understand why BS&A does not handle adjustment files.

Bill Images
Supported: 
Web Services (PDF Linking)
PDF Extraction (.PDF file format)
Text file (Template)
Most commonly implemented: Web Services for PDF Linking
Also Supported: FTP for PDF Extraction
BS&A can provided images or if the biller uses a third party print vendor, we can support PDF Linking or PDF Extraction with the third party. The benefit to using BS&A for bill images is that the PDF file can be transferred to IC via SFTP automatically from BS&A (automation can be configured after the bill cycle is run - the invoice file and the PDF file will be transmitted to IC) 
Commonly used: 
PDF Linking with BS&A Direct Reports

CloudPay

CloudPay Web Services
Not Supported
CloudStore
Supported
Payments will not be sent through data pump
Example invoice types: Cemetery, Police, etc. 
If these payments are also taken in Cash Receipting, one invoice type should be configured for both payment channels - 1. CloudStore setup for online presence and 2. the same invoice type ID will be used by Cash Receipting for POS payments. 
Don’t forget
, CloudStore payments will not post to BS&A but cash receipting payments will post directly into BS&A.
CSRConnect
Required
CSRConnect is used in two ways with BS&A:
Used with BS&A Cash Receipting (sometimes referred to as Cashiering). Cash Receipting is a counter payment service within BS&A that can be used with any invoice type.
These payments are not sent via data pump but instead are posted directly into BS&A at the time of payment. Entirety of customer/clerk experience is held within BS&A, including payment posting.
Example invoice types: Photocopies, Trash bags, Hall Rental, Animal Licensing, Cemetery Management, Police Department, Parks, Beach, Cemetery, Planning Commission
From the BS&A online portal, customers are redirected to CSRconnect (one-time pay/redirect 7) to make a payment. This redirect is not configurable per biller.
These payments can originate from BS&A Online but don’t have to. If the payment does originate in BS&A online, the payer is redirected to IC CSRConnect one-time payments. Those payments are marked as "Express Payments". BS&A does NOT use the CloudPay logic (even though the experience looks similar). A BS&A client can use a Cloud Store, however, those are not integrated with BS&A online. Billers will have to manually post and reconcile payments.
If the payments do not originate in BS&A Online (ex: originate from the biller website), the payer is redirected to the IC virtual site landing page to do an invoice search. 
Example invoice types: Utility, Summer Tax, Winter Tax, Village Tax, Delinquent (county) and Delinquent Personal Property (local) Tax, Misc. Receivables, Special Assessments, Building Permits, Business Licenses, General Receipts

IVR
Supported
Search by Account Number
Note: IC Sales sets up all BS&A billers with a ‘percentage’ service fee model to avoid the need for multiple IVR TDs.

Not Supported
Online Bank Direct - OBD
Supported
Standard functionality
Note: OBD payments are deposited into one bank account, regardless of the number of IC Invoice Types. Most BS&A billers have a legal requirement for tax payments and utility payments to be deposited into separate bank accounts. To ensure compliance with this regulation, BS&A billers only implement OBD for one invoice type (generally utility payments).
