Added OP change control process
1. 
Overview
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the process for submitting, evaluating, and approving change requests that arise after the Solution Design Document (SDD) has been signed off, or any change request for projects where a SDD was not used.  Any new requirements introduced post-SDD must follow this formal change request workflow to ensure proper assessment and alignment with the project's scope, timeline, and budget.
Change requests are categorized to help determine their impact and urgency, ranging from minor adjustments to major changes that may block go-live. This SOP also distinguishes between Product Change Requests and Integration Modifications, each with its own documentation and approval path.
By following this process, stakeholders can ensure that all changes are properly triaged, documented, reviewed, and implemented in a controlled and transparent manner, minimizing risk and maintaining project integrity.
2. 
Scope
This SOP applies to all InvoiceCloud new biller implementation projects.  It covers the entire lifecycle of change management, from the initial discovery phase to biller Go-Live.
3. 
Definitions
Change Control
: The process of managing changes to the project scope, including new requirements, modifications, or deletions of previously agreed-upon requirements.

Solution Design Document
 
(SDD):
 A formal document that details all custom requirements identified during the discovery phase, including integration and custom product requirements. The SDD document is created only for new integrations and custom projects.
Change Request (CR)

Documentation
Solution Design Document (SDD)

: Significant impact on the project, requiring adjustments to the scope, timeline, or budget.
Major Change (Go-Live Blocker)
 - Same as Major Change but 
required by customer to Go-Live
.
There are 3 types of change Requests:

Document Change Request
The

 will be responsible for documenting integration and product related change requests.  
A Change Request Form must be completed 
IC Project Manager
, detailing the nature of the change, its impact on the project, and any associated costs. (See Change Request Form on top of this document)
The Change Request Form should include a clear description of the requested change, justification for the change, and an analysis of its impact to the implementation.
Seek Implementations Approval
The IC Project Manager will bring the change control document to the Implementations Triage meeting to ensure scope is clear and to check if there is a workaround or if the team is aware of an available solution that may solve the issue and hence avoid the 
change. 
For GUB & FS
 - 
 Implementation CR triage call is held on Tuesday’s/Thursday 10-11 am EST

The PM/IM will relay this T-Shirt Size to the customer to gain approval to move forward with full detail scoping.
If approved to proceed is granted from Customer, Product will place the request in the queue to be fully scoped with enough details to generate a SOW.  Product may approve the change but add the request to the backlog and not commit to a delivery date.
