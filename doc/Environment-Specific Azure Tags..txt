Azure Tagging Strategy
Introduction
We apply a standardized set of tags across all Azure resources using 
Terraform
.
Tags are defined per environment in 
.tfvars
 files and extended at the resource level when necessary.
This ensures 
consistent cost tracking and  ownership.
Tagging Standards
Tag Key
Purpose
Allowed Values / Rules
Applicability
environment
Identifies the deployment environment
prd
, 
xat
, 
iat
, 
qar
, 
sbx
, 
dev
 
npd
Mandatory for all resources
component
Classifies the workload tier or service
app
, 
web
, 
database
, 
avd
Mandatory for all resources
network_lane
Differentiates network zones
prod
 = Primary Subscription, Enterprise Prod 
non-prod
 = Enterprise Dev/Test, Sandbox 
npd
 = AVD Non-Prod
Mandatory for all resources
cost-of-revenue
Flags revenue-related environments
yes
 = 
prd
, 
xat
 
no
 = 
sbx
, 
dev
, 
iat
, 
qar
, 
npd
Mandatory for all resources
owner
Assigns responsibility for resource types
platform
 = compute resources 
data-services
 = database resources 
avd-*
 = AVD resource owner
Optional
 → used when resource requires accountability
name
Provides a unique, descriptive resource name
Follows convention: 
<service>-<project>-<region>-<environment>
 (e.g., 
avd-Abethina1-pri-eus-avd1-npd
)
Optional
 → typically used for AVD or resources where extra clarity is required
Environment-Specific Tagging
Production (prd)
 → 
cost-of-revenue = yes
, 
network_lane = prod
, 
environment = prd
User Acceptance (xat)
 → 
cost-of-revenue = yes
, 
network_lane = prod
, 
environment = xat
Integration (iat)
 → 
cost-of-revenue = no
, 
network_lane = non-prod
, 
environment = iat
Quality Assurance (qar)
 → 
cost-of-revenue = no
, 
network_lane = non-prod
, 
environment = qar
Sandbox (sbx)
 → 
cost-of-revenue = no
, 
network_lane = non-prod
, 
environment = sbx
Development (dev)
 → 
cost-of-revenue = no
, 
network_lane = non-prod
, 
environment = dev
Non-Production Desktop (npd)
 → 
cost-of-revenue = no
, 
network_lane = npd
, 
environment = npd
Resource-Specific Tagging
Compute resources
 (e.g., VMs, App Services): 
owner = platform
Database resources
 (e.g., SQL Servers, Cosmos DB): 
owner = data-services
AVD resources
 (e.g., Azure Virtual Desktops):
component = avd
environment = npd
 (or applicable environment)
cost-of-revenue = no
 (in non-prod)
network-lane = npd
name
 (optional, descriptive) → 
avd-<project>-<region>-<environment>
owner
 (optional, user/team specific) → 
avd-<team or user>
 (e.g., 
avd-aflaherty1
)
