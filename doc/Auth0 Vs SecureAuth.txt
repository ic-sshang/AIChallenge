A page to provide some highlights of the comparison between the Identity Providers Auth0 and SecureAuth.
Why we are only comparing these two on this page?
We researched and compared various competitive Identity providers available in the Market to identify and compare the various attributes from those IDPs but based on the various features offered, Auth0, SecureAuth, KeyCloak and PingID are the ones which offer almost all those features and functionalities. 
We then ruled our KeyCloak because it is an open source solution and can have risks on the security aspects.
Based on the spike done by the PRISM team, we got to know that the PING ID is not very suitable with the .Net technology and the Auth0 and SecureAuth can be more compatible for our Biller Portal at Invoice Cloud.
Pricing Models received from Auth0 and SecureAuth:

Features Comparison:
Here's a detailed comparison of 
Auth0
 and 
SecureAuth
 specifically for Identity Management (IDM) with 
Single Sign-On (SSO)
 and 
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
, in context of a 
.NET-based SaaS application in the Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment (EBPP) domain
.
🔍 Contextual Considerations for EBPP SaaS in .NET
Compliance & Security:
 PCI DSS, SOC2, and GDPR are often mandatory.
User Types:
 Mix of consumers (retail), business users (enterprise portals), and possibly internal admin users.
Integration:
 .NET stack, likely using 
ASP.NET
 Core and SQL-based backend.
Scalability:
 Support for growing user base with high security expectations.
UX:
 Frictionless user experience while maintaining strong security.

 Drawbacks
SSO Capabilities
Full SAML, OIDC, OAuth2 support. Strong support for B2B and B2C SSO.
Strong support for enterprise SSO with adaptive risk-based access control.
SecureAuth 
does support SAML, OIDC, and OAuth2
, but 
with nuances
. 
Not designed for high-scale B2C applications. Lacks native support for hosted login experiences, social logins, or scalable multi-tenant B2C auth without heavy customization.
Here's a focused breakdown for the capabilities we are comparing:
✅ SecureAuth – Protocol Support Overview
Protocol
Support Level
Notes
SAML 2.0
✅ Full
Core protocol; SecureAuth is very strong in enterprise SSO via SAML, especially for internal users or partner orgs.
OIDC (OpenID Connect)
✅ Partial to Full
Available, but not as seamless as in developer-centric platforms like Auth0. Configuration can be more complex.
OAuth 2.0
✅ Partial
SecureAuth supports OAuth 2.0 for delegated access, but it's primarily focused on securing web and enterprise apps, not API-first or SaaS-first experiences.
🔁 B2B and B2C SSO Support
Capability
Support Level
Comments
B2B SSO
✅ Strong
SecureAuth is well-suited for enterprise federation (via SAML/LDAP/ADFS). You can integrate multiple identity providers (IdPs) for partner orgs.
B2C SSO
⚠️ Limited
Not designed for high-scale B2C applications. Lacks native support for hosted login experiences, social logins, or scalable multi-tenant B2C auth without heavy customization.
Summary
Feature
SecureAuth Support
Full SAML 2.0
✅ Yes
Full OpenID Connect (OIDC)
✅ With effort
Full OAuth2
✅ But more limited
B2B SSO
✅ Strong
B2C SSO
⚠️ Weak
🔍 Takeaway for Us
If your SaaS app is 
primarily B2B (e.g., bill presentment portals for businesses or municipalities)
 and you can manage SSO federation per client, SecureAuth can support you — 
but you may encounter friction in dev workflows
.
However, if you want:
Out-of-the-box support for social logins
, customizable hosted pages, and dynamic onboarding of consumer users (B2C),
Simple OIDC/OAuth2 integration
 into a .NET API-first stack,
Or if you're planning 
self-service onboarding
, lightweight tenants, or embedded login UIs,
Then 
Auth0 is a better fit
.
✅ Summary: Does Auth0 Provide Strong Enterprise SSO + Adaptive Risk-Based Access?
Capability
Auth0 Support
Notes
Enterprise SSO (SAML, OIDC, WS-Fed)
✅ Strong
Fully supported, widely used in B2B SaaS.
Federated IdPs per tenant
✅ Excellent
Via “Organizations” feature.
Adaptive MFA
✅ Yes
Built-in + configurable rules.
Risk-based conditional access
✅ Moderate to Strong
Some features are native; others require rules, actions, or external services.
Developer/Policy Customization
✅ High
Via extensibility framework (Rules, Actions, Hooks).
🚀 Conclusion
Yes, 
Auth0 provides strong enterprise SSO and solid adaptive access controls
, particularly for SaaS providers in the 
B2B or B2B2C space
. For high-stakes security workflows (like those in 
Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment
), Auth0 is well-suited — and scalable.
MFA Options
SMS, Email, TOTP, Push via Guardian app, WebAuthn, Duo integration
TOTP, Push, WebAuthn, Biometric, Phone call, SMS, FIDO2
If you 
require Guardian or Duo specifically
, SecureAuth may not be ideal.
 But if you're open to using 
SecureAuth's own MFA app and ecosystem
, it 
does provide comprehensive MFA coverage
, including modern protocols like WebAuthn.
Auth0 supports all modern MFA methods except voice/phone call MFA
. If that method is essential, you’ll need custom integration. 
For a 
.NET-based SaaS in EBPP
, the current support covers most compliance and usability needs.
.NET Integration
SDKs for 
ASP.NET
 Core, OWIN, Web API; easy integration with IdentityModel
Native .NET integration available; documentation less developer-centric

.NET SDKs & Tooling
✅ Excellent – Official SDKs for 
http://ASP.NET
  Core, Web API, Blazor
⚠️ Limited – Mostly standards-based, fewer modern SDKs
Integration Simplicity
✅ Easy – Plug-and-play with middleware, OIDC templates
❌ Manual – Relies on SAML, WS-Fed, or custom token handling
Hosted Login (Universal Login)
✅ Yes – Fully customizable and hosted
⚠️ Partial – Requires more on-premise effort
API Protection (OAuth2/OIDC)
✅ Full support for securing APIs via bearer tokens
⚠️ SAML-centric – OAuth2/OIDC support is functional but secondary
B2B/B2C Use Cases
✅ Strong support – via “Organizations” & self-service onboarding
⚠️ Primarily B2B – B2C flows require customization
Documentation for .NET
✅ Rich, current, scenario-based docs
❌ Sparse or dated – Less guidance for modern .NET Core apps
Deployment Model
✅ Cloud-native – SaaS, multitenant
⚠️ Primarily on-premise or private cloud
MFA & Adaptive Access in .NET Flows
✅ Built-in support, configurable via dashboard or Actions
⚠️ Complex – Often requires manual logic
Logging & Debugging for Developers
✅ Excellent – Real-time logs, debugging tools
⚠️ Basic – More sysadmin-focused than dev-centric
Dev Onboarding & Test Environments
✅ Free tier + tenant separation
❌ Less developer-friendly – licensing-based dev/test environments
Developer Experience
Excellent docs, quickstarts, and UI SDKs for .NET. CI/CD-friendly
Less developer-focused, more enterprise/IT admin configuration oriented
Security Compliance
SOC2, ISO27001, GDPR, HIPAA, and supports PCI-DSS apps
Strong on compliance; FICAM, FedRAMP-ready (for U.S. public sector)
Both provide the same security compliance features.
User Management
Hosted user management UI + APIs; extensible via Rules & Actions
Strong user directory with adaptive policies and advanced threat intel
Customization & Branding
High: Customizable login pages, hosted or embedded login
Moderate: More enterprise-configurable than developer-customizable
Adaptive Authentication
Yes: Risk-based MFA, IP filtering, anomaly detection
Yes: Strong adaptive policies based on location, device, IP, behavior
Pricing Model
Pay-as-you-go (MAU-based); startup and enterprise plans
Typically enterprise licensing; contact for pricing
Multi-tenancy Support
Excellent; ideal for B2B2C SaaS with tenant isolation
Limited; better suited to single-tenant or B2E (Business to Employee) use
SSO Federation for Enterprises
Strong support (SAML, WS-Fed, OIDC); ideal for B2B SaaS
Also strong, but often positioned for internal enterprise use cases
Customer Support
Good for paid tiers; rich community and marketplace
Enterprise-focused support, often with dedicated account managers
Hosting & Deployment
Fully cloud-based (Auth0 by Okta); global availability
On-prem, cloud, and hybrid deployment available
