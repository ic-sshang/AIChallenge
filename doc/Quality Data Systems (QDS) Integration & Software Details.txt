Invoice
TXT
FTP 
If you ever get a BIF from QDS in format "IC0105302018165", you can tell by the following digit of IC(#) of what the file type is. 1 = Real Estate, 2 = Personal Property, 3 = Regular Motor Vehicle, 4 = Supplemental Motor Vehicle.
IC creates invoices from the BIF and on the fly for registration.
QDS has custom logic in the Virtual Site to create invoices for customers. When a customer looks up their invoice on the QDS site, IC then pulls the QDS Invoice Data from their QDS’s servers and creates a single invoice record using our web service Cloud Invoicing → UploadInvoice.
QDS loads the BIF in the qds FTP to the specific town code folder.
Adjustments/Balances
RTDR
QDS takes a snapshot of each biller every night. When we do a RTDR callout, the 'updated' balance comes from that snapshot...not a true RTDR.
Payments
TXT
Email
Sent via Lockbox as email attachment daily
 - the email address that the payment file gets sent to is pulled from the Biller Portal ‘Batch Close Notification Email’
Biller has the option to have the payment files split by CC and ACH for each day: If SplitPaymentFile is set to True, 2 files are generated. 1 with “ICPayments-ACH” and another 1 with “ICPayments-CC” followed by the DateTime (ex. ICPayments-ACH-20220423230638.txt | ICPayments-CC-20220423230638.txt)
