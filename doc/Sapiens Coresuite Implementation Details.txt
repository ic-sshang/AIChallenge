Integration Requirements and Pre-Requisites
Integration configuration in Sapiens 10.4 release (NOTE: there are no code constraints to configure in older environment. The biller would need to dual key if on earlier environment to recreate the configuration in an earlier release)
If there are issues with Data Pump for ‘createRemitBatch’, confirm with Sapiens that it’s not an Azure issue (during integration coding, there was an issue with Azure, a  firewall rule that this request was tripping. Sapiens noted that for biller implementations, the team must ensure the WAF settings are the same as its currently tied to the fndmtr-api endpoint).

Configuration
Invoice Types
164-173. Sapiens can pass IC more than one invoicetypeID and will use the ‘insurance' IDs.
Invoice Types
The Invoice Type configuration needs to be adjusted to map the ‘TotalAmountDue’ field to display for ‘BalanceDue’. When Sapiens initiates a jump to CloudPay for Down Payments, only one ‘balance’ field is allow and will be in the ‘TotalAmountDue’ field. If this configuration is not updated, the virtual site payment route will show $0.00 in the Balance Due column.
Virtual Site
Account Number may be referenced as ‘Policy’ or ‘Account’ Number
