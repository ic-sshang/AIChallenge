Agreement discussed on 
 with:

It has been decided to have a separation of accountability and responsibility between the Platform Team and the App Dev Teams that own the Services (and the Source Code for the Services).  The Platform Team will work on Infrastructure, ADO Build and Deploy Pipeline, and Infrastructure Observability change items.  The App Dev Teams will work on the Service Source Code and Docker File (containerization) change items.  This will allow and enable the App Dev Teams to understand the changes to the Source Code required for Containerization and Kubernetes hosting so they will be able to better support the Service and Source Code moving forward.
