Problem Alignment
The Problem
We have a couple different ways existing to receive payer feedback and then provide this internally and externally. As we have new tools such as Pendo, a growing CSM team looking for more payer feedback we want to provide an provide an easy to use, inviting way for payers to give feedback and with different measurements/depth of feedback, and seamless practice internally for understanding and sharing the feedback.
Why: How do we know this is a real problem and worth solving?
We know this is a problem worth solving because we have multiple ways/tools to gather feedback now and there is some confusion internally on when feedback is gathered, from who, and how to access the results. This document aims to be an internal guide for understanding our payer feedback practices going forward, where each department can access and use the feedback, 
Audience: Who are we building for?
For our internal teams, mainly CSM, Product and Design
High-level Approach
We plan on using Pendo guides with open feedback and rating, as well as quarterly UX research to gather payer feedback.  
Pendo open text feedback on confirmation pages
to be utilized and shared with CSM team
( Could we later use payer feedback to share with Billers without a CSM, via email? )
Pendo site rating on confirmation pages 
to be utilized and shared with CSM team
Quarterly UX research 
used by product and design in quarterly UX research reports
Success
Product, Design and CSM teams have access to valuable payer feedback to help inform product and design decisions and share with the billers.
Solution Alignment
Current Tools/ Initiatives 
In CRM we have a reporting tool Consumer Survey Responses → PRDCT-Q4: Easy to use – 2022. This is done annually. 
Existing and ongoing “Have 30 Seconds?” → invitation to be part of UX Research Quarterly report.

UX
Frequency 
We will be running this on all billers on the virtual site and customer portal confirmation pages at  a certain low percent of traffic so not all payers see this and we will not resurface the guide for a certain amount of time so this is not seen every time. 
Access 
Access to feedback will be collect from an export out of Pendo and sent monthly? to CSM team.
