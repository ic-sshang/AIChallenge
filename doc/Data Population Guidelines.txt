There are several means by which we can add data to the CMDB. Here they are, listed in preferential order. 
If you can get the desired data into the CMDB with a 3rd party integration, do that! If not, write a custom script to do it. Otherwise, don’t do it.
If you can get the data into the CMDB using an import / an integration, you should do that. Writing custom code to create objects ourselves should only occur when there is no usable integration. 
Imports (3rd party integrations)
Jira Assets offers the 
import
 utility, allowing for integrations with other platforms
One great example is 
Azure Sync for Jira Assets
, an integration that uses an import to pull data from Azure into Assets
We may need to supplement the CI's created with an import, i.e. adding links between these CI's and others in our CMDB that came from other integrations. Anything of this nature should be accomplished using the API (nothing manual!) and should be scripted to run periodically, i.e. every 12 hours, iterate through all relevant assets and create any appropriate links.
API Updates (in house integrations)
We can use the Assets API to create and update CI'S as we make changes to them
A good example of this is deploying IIS applications to servers. We could add a step to the deployment that calls the Assets API to link the CI for web app version X to the server that is newly hosting it
These should be scripted rather than manually API calls. Furthermore, they should be idempotent and should run periodically to ensure that our CMDB stays updated (as opposed to only running on updates).
Manual Updates
These should be avoided
For now, I propose that we simply do not make any manual changes. Anything we manage manually will be untracked in the CMDB. Our focus will be on tracking what we can with automation to start
