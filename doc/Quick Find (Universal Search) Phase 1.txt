Universal Search (Phase 1 - Account Search)
Problem Alignment
The Problem
Current search experiences in the Biller Portal are siloed and fragmented. Users must navigate between specific search pages and nested pages in the Customer Profile to find information, leading to inefficiency and frustration. Specifically, searching for accounts, invoices, and payments requires navigating through multiple reports and pages, which is cumbersome and time-consuming.
Why: How do we know this is a real problem and worth solving?
This problem is meaningful because it directly impacts the efficiency of customer service representatives, finance teams, and other users of the Biller Portal. Inefficient search processes lead to:
Reduced productivity as users spend excessive time searching across the platform
Longer response times in handling customer queries
User frustration and cognitive overload
Potential decrease in customer satisfaction and retention
Additionally, if we do not address this issue, we may fall behind competitors who offer more streamlined search capabilities.
Audience: Who are we building for?
We are building this feature for biller portal users, including customer service representatives, finance teams, and internal staff who assist billers.
High-level Approach
Implement a Universal Search feature that provides a unified search experience across accounts, invoices, and payments. This feature will allow users to search using a single search bar, supporting various identifiers like names, account numbers, invoice numbers, addresses, emails, etc., and provide real-time, as-you-type search results.
Success
How do we know if we’ve solved this problem?
We will be successful if:
The time spent searching for information is reduced, as measured by user feedback or analytics
The number of support tickets related to navigation or content discovery decreases by X% within X months of launch
User satisfaction with the search functionality improves, as indicated by surveys or feedback
We observe increased efficiency in handling customer queries and improved productivity among users
Solution Alignment
Key Features
A single search bar with helpful hints (e.g., "Start typing a name, account number, email address, etc.")
A clear button to reset the search
A list of matching results with partially highlighted matching strings (e.g., "whit" would highlight "Whit" in "John Whitworth")
Visual indication of the selected result (pressing ENTER will open that customer profile)
Display of the number of matching results (e.g., "X matching results" or "...and X more results")
Real-time, as-you-type search results for quick access to information
Requirements
The search should support full or partial entries of various identifiers
Results should include Accounts with relevant information such as account number, customer name, email address, etc.
The feature should be intuitive and match the current design of the Biller Portal
It should improve user efficiency and reduce the time spent searching for information
Deliverables include the search bar, clear button, list of results with highlighting, and indication of selected result
