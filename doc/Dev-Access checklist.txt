Steps to Bypass Biller Portal Login (Dev) on Localhost
Login to the Dev Okta SSO.
Open the Dev CRM Portal:
 
https://devtest.invoicecloud.com/crm/Blank.aspx
 
Navigate to Users:
 Go to 
Users > Login as this user
. This will open a webpage in a new tab.
Copy the URL:
 Copy the URL starting from 
BillerLogin.aspx?EBG=Guid
 and place it after the localhost URL opened by running the code.
Automatic Login:
 You will now automatically be logged in with that biller portal and user in your localhost site. Enjoy debugging!
Note:
 Sometimes the URL redirects too quickly to see the EBG value. You can use browser extensions like Redirect Path to save the redirected URL, so you can copy and use it in the localhost site.
