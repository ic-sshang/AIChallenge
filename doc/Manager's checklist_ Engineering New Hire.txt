Manager’s checklist

Determine if your new employee will need their own unique BID for testing or if they can suffice using your shared team BID. 




Engineering new hires are not automatically given their own BID.
Managers decide if the new hire should use their team's share BID or have a unique BID created. This decision should be done prior to new hire Day 1.
If the decision is to use the team BID managers need to provide training and access on that in week 1.
If the decision is to create a unique BID for the new hire it is the manager's responsibility to create the new BID 
and confirm set up is accurate before Day 3 of new hire's first week.

New hires with unique BIDs would then be responsible for adding in data as needed for their use cases.
Day by day to-do’s
Day 1: 
Check in with your new employee to make sure their laptop set up and SSO set up is done and no issues. 
Day 2: 
Make a list of which code repos they’ll need to pull down first  (tomorrow’s exercise) 
Make yourself available in case there are questions they have when doing the self-paced training.  
Check to see if there are any outstanding access or permissions issues and help submit tickets or follow ups as needed. 
Day 3:
Check in with your new employee to get them started on pulling down code repos and familiarizing themselves with the codebase. 
Check to see if there are any outstanding access or permissions issues and help submit tickets or follow ups as needed. 
Day 4:
Make sure your new employee has joined all the appropriate Slack channels. Consider sending out a welcome note in the ones your team is most active on. 
Day 5:
Have a quick check-in to see how week 1 went. 
Are there any major areas of confusion? 
Are there any lingering access or permissions issues? 
What is resonating with them so far?
