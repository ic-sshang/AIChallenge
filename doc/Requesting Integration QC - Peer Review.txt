Please request a review for:
Projects over $10,000 MRR

How to request a review
In your project schedule, find the “Complete QC Integration - Peer Review” line as shown below, and set the Task Status to “Requested”. This will alert the reviewers that your projects is in their queue. 
Your peer reviewer will assign themselves to your review in the “Task Assigned To” column and will update the task status to “In Progress” and finally to “Completed”. 
Your peer reviewer will communicate the results of the review with you on the linked checklist, as part of your project artifacts.

Enter your comments in the “IM Comments” column. E.g.: Corrected on 8/21/24
If you have questions regarding the QC findings, contact your reviewer

If you notice a knowledge gap based on your review results, please address it. If unsure how, contact your manager or team lead.
