Summary
Attention
: InCode billers must have access to Incode’s 
Output Director interface
 to export files required for integration.
Most InCode billers have 
file output capabilities
, but those who still print their bills in-house may not have invested in the output interface. Ask if they are still printing in-house to avoid potential conflicts during implementation.
Related questions when scoping
: How are you printing bills? Do you have the output module?
Most InCode billers already have 
file import capabilities
 for use with check scanners or lockbox file imports. Regardless, ask the biller how they currently import payment files to InCode to avoid potential conflicts during implementation.
