Retrospective
Add your Start doing, Stop doing, and Keep doing items to the table below. We'll use these to talk about how we can improve our process going forward.
 
Start doing
Stop doing
Keep doing
Random Thoughts/Music Request
add the BDD scenarios to all items in backlog so they are ready when pulled in mid sprint or add as they are pulled in.
Make Michael earn his keep.
Alternatively, keep getting sick so Kelsey has to keep doing all the work. -10
Grooming sessions with Integrations with the Integrations team or include them in our calls? +1
For items that involve the Integrations team.
When we have an item related to integrations, pull them into a call sooner so we aren’t blindsided by any requirements. Oh,lol, like above this one. 👍
not leaving comments in Jira story when item has been moved to BLOCKED. people outside of devs need to know why something is BLOCKED (especially EOD) (i.e. execs and people between us and the clients)
Really, we should be adding a comment on every status change 
saying something is DONE DONE when code changes are still clearly needed. i’m not sure if this is done because someone is in a hurry, they’re bored with their item or something else. items that i keep seeing:
repeated code instead of refactoring
not using existing methods/functions that are already doing what you need
implementing a solution in one spot and when there is another spot that could use the same solution, something else different is used instead
not thoroughly testing solutions making sure that we don’t introduce something new or missed a spot that needs to be cleaned up
not getting the latest every day; this should be a hardcore ritual in our book (i see this one not followed again, and again, and again, and again)
 
Working hard
Completing items!
Helping billers Go Live!
Keep rooting for Saints even though everyone knows they will still lose +1
Always! They will turn it around soon. 👏
9-8, or 8-9
with this mentality, you may as well become a Cowboys fan. they’ve been letting us down for 25+ years
Go Saints!
Winter Fridays +1
We found out the source of our Bullmastiff’s aggression. Short answer: catnip.
Boston Stripe was due last year; someone in CRC had asked if it was truly now necessary to implement? do they truly need it still?
I think they have an annual contract with Stripe
Fully remote.
Super Bowl picks?
