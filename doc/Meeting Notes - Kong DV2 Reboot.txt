Legacy APIs still need to support 
www.invoicecloud.com
 
api.invoicecloud.com
 will go thru Kong, this is scheduled to be deployed to Production on 9/8/2024
We will begin to expose the Lower Environments for Next Gen and Kong leading up to 9/8/2024.
Below are the hostnames that will be exposed publicly for lower environment testing for 
api
 flavor of hostnames.
api-dev.invoicecloud-beta.com
api-iat.invoicecloud-beta.com
api-qar.invoicecloud-beta.com
api-xat.invoicecloud-beta.com
Rob will work on getting the TLS Certificate for 
*.invoicecloud-beta.com
 and the architecture Team will define which Paths represent API Paths for the Legacy hostnames listed below:
www.invoicecloud.com
www2.invoicecloud.com
www3.invoicecloud.com
 
www4.invoicecloud.com
nsp.invoicecloud.com
 
ncf.invoicecloud.com
Additional Hostnames that are only APIs:
icg-payments.invoicecloud.com
icg-reporting.invoicecloud.com
icg-boarding.invoicecloud.com
Possible use in API but not in the initial round (i.e. not a high priority)
internal.invoicecloud.com
Host file entry on CS Term, Web Servers, research where else the host files may used for this DNS.
Will need to research which Apps are using 
internal.invoicecloud.com
 with the help of the following teams:
Team Spam
Team Integrations
Expected Timeline
Texas Mutual needs a portion of the APIs to be routed thru Kong for their testing in early 2024.
SWAG Q4 Goal (by end of year) to get the needed APIs routing thru Kong.
CloudInvoicing
 is believed to be the only API Texas Mutual needs at this time but more research is needed by 
 and the Architecture team.
 is working on scoping the initial needs.
