Start Q4 Epics
Story points
We 34 points, but we had 8 Points get added due to the BillerMailgunMessageStatusJob surge which altered the Sprint landscape.
Summary
Got a good start on Q4 Epics and specifically made progress on the Redis Cache Remodel and the ADO Agent Codification effort.  The BillerMailgunMessageStatusJob was completed within the Sprint, which entailed Containerizing and deploying the Workload to a K8s Cluster, note there is some additional follow up work scheduled for the Quarter to move to Biller Domain Cluster.

Potential risks
Risk
Mitigation
Due to carry-over from Sprint 7, we had to push some items from Sprint 8 which puts Q4 Goals at risk.
Prior Sprint Retro
Well: Keep Doing
Surge went well and we were able to achieve the Goal of deploying to Production codified within Sprint7
Cross training on items spreading knowledge within the Team
Achieved 75% scheduled velocity
Made progress on the Q4 Grooming and figuring out what the Planned Velocity is for Goals in the Quarter.
What should we change?
We will be changing the Workflow of our Jira Items which will help reflecting Item status better.  Do note, there will be some more information required as we work items in Jira.
Tough to get Testers to volunteer.  Should we get a full-time QE resource to help with this?  
Proposal for solution we can control:
 we have one person per Sprint play the Role of Tester and they do not get scheduled capacity in the Sprint and they focus on Testing and helping evolve an automated testing standard practices/framework.
Tough to get PRs to volunteer this Sprint due to surge.
Didn’t go well: Stop doing
Brought in unexpected work which had large impacts on Sprint, not only with the unplanned work we did but also drained time for people to help train/knowledge share with other members on our team.
Any time anyone is planning on introducing a new Application/Service, this should go thru an Architecture and Infrastructure review at the beginning of the Application/Service build out, not at the end!
Talk with 
 and 
 about getting a re-occurring new application review board meeting setup at the beginning of each Sprint (say Thursday) where any team planning on starting work on a new Application joins the meeting and outlines the need (plan if they have one) and we can discuss the Governance aspects we need to see in the Application design.
