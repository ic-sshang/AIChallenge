HIGH PRAISE FOR ENHANCED HISTORY,

Notes
Adoption Rate
Over 60% of payments are now made online, showing steady growth in digital adoption.
Customer portal, auto pay, and IVR are the most popular payment methods for customers.
Continued growth in online payments and adoption metrics is positive, but more work is needed to reach remaining customers.
Enhanced History
Pam said that the history feature that was added is very helpful.
She said it's useful both for the CSRs when assisting customers, as well as for the customer support team when trying to diagnose issues.
Having the full activity history in one place makes it easier to see what actions a customer has taken and help address their needs more efficiently.
Online Bank Direct
They expressed interest in OBD.
They currently receive those payments through their local bank that are funneled from various payment processors. It sounded like OBD could potentially replace or supplement this process.
They asked about the matching process, reports available, and fees associated with OBD.
Possibly considering the potential value and implementation of using this payment option.
Upcoming BP Enhancements
Upcoming enhancements like file dashboard and improved permissions will save time and provide better visibility.
Capricorn issue
Since migrating to the Capricorn system, CSRs can no longer "impersonate" customers like they could in the previous system when assisting over the phone.
In the old system, when a CSR impersonated a customer, it would bring them into the same view the customer sees when making payments online. 
However, in Capricorn the customer view is separate from what the CSR sees when they login to InvoiceCloud. So CSRs have difficulty walking customers through payment processes step-by-step.
This is frustrating for CSRs as they can no longer see exactly what the customer is seeing and describing, making it hard to assist them effectively over the phone. It also leads to longer call times as they try to troubleshoot issues without being able to mimic the customer experience.
Marketing Resource Center
They seemed interested in utilizing the marketing resource center and templates to help drive further adoption through targeted campaigns and materials placed both online and in physical locations.
Audit Log
Some email communications sent from the system to customers are not visible when viewing a customer's activity history in InvoiceCloud.
Specifically, they called out wanting to be able to see the email sent when a customer signs up for auto pay, as this currently does not show in the activity history.
It would be useful for CSRs and support to have visibility into all emails sent, such as notifications for payments or enrollment confirmations.
Without seeing these emails, it is harder for CSRs assisting customers over the phone to verify details about past communications or transactions if a customer has a question.
