Ensure that the property “default branch for manual and scheduled builds” is set to the main branch for both the build and deploy pipelines. If the pipeline was created when the repository’s default branch was different than it currently is, this value may not have been updated. See 
this guide
.
Ensure that your app’s build and deploy pipelines have no parameters without default values.
You can use 
''
 for the default if you want to force users to provide a value when manually triggering your pipeline
Configure CI triggers for your build pipeline. We only want these to run for release candidates, as we don’t have enough agents to build every app on every commit.
# build.yaml
trigger:  
  batch: true  
  branches:  
    include:  
    - main 
Configure your build pipeline as a resource trigger in your deployment pipeline.
# deploy.yaml
resources:
  pipelines:
    - pipeline: build # this is an alias that we'll use in a bit
      source: /2.0/ICCRM/Build ICCRM # this is the full path to your build pipeline
      trigger:
        branches:
          include:
            - main # should match branch name configured as a CI trigger in your build pipeline
Update the 
default values
 of the parameters for the version and the DevTest parameter only if they are present in the template.
parameters:
  - name: devtest
    displayName: DevTest Environment
    type: string
    default: none #Only in place to enable CD triggers. Not actually used. When triggering the pipeline manually, the user must provide a real value (e.g., 'devtest6') or the pipeline will throw an error
  - name: version
    displayName: Artifact Version
    type: string
    default: '' #Only in place to enable CD triggers. Not actually used. When triggering the pipeline manually, the user must provide a value for 'version' parameter to specify the version that needs to be used.
Add a conditional to your deployment pipeline that provides 
$(resources.pipeline.build.runName)
 as the app version to deploy if the pipeline was triggered because the build pipeline completed a run. This works because our build pipelines update the run name to be the artifact version published during that build.
# deploy.yaml
${{ if eq(variables['Build.Reason'], 'ResourceTrigger') }}:
  version: $(resources.pipeline.build.runName) # 'build' here is the alias established in the pipeline resource trigger
${{ else }}:
  version: ${{ parameters.version }}

Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run.
Continuous Delivery (CD) is a software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for a release to production.
Continuous Deployment (CD) is a software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to production.
We try to implement continuous delivery and have no current plans of making the entire production release process automated.
