The process we are putting in place now is to have a feedback mechanism to improve both the ticket submission and resolution quality. 
Any ticket that meets the below criteria can be flagged for CS Review
No clear problem statement and expected behavior
Insufficient Triage information
Tickets that you think don’t need DS Support - When you don’t need to perform DB Query or Code Analysis.
Anything that can be found in Biller Portal, Customer Portal and CRM should be handled by CS - Default
When one of the above criteria is met. Label the DS ticket with CS_Review Label and add a note in the internal notes on the reason for CS Review
Sample Notes:
typescript
CS_Review: Basic Information like account number or invoice id is missing
