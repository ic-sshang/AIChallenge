Overview


Overview


Training and User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is an important part of the Add on project. Training ensures the Biller can feel confident in their use of the product and UAT helps to ensure that the product functions correctly in production conditions.  This UAT varies for Add on projects because often we deploy directly into the Production environment and do not have a TEST BID to utilize. There are some products that do require a TEST BID and UAT is an integral part of pre-Go-Live activities.

Training & Testing
Provide Training Opportunity to Biller
IS provides training information and links to available training in the Kickoff email since the timeline for an Add on Project can be accelerated.  While training may not be as necessary since the Biller already has been using Invoice Cloud and they should be familiar with the Biller Portal, there may be new users associated with the new product who need training. The type of training and documentation of training varies by Add on products.  Training is referenced in the Welcome email samples on your project schedule.  All available Biller Facing training can be found 
Biller Portal>Support>Training>Training Documentation or Training Videos 
as well as 
Biller Portal>Support>Enroll in Live Training 
or 
Biller Portal>Support>Customer Support>Visit Support Central 
(must be logged in as a Biller not a Support User to view Support Central information).
