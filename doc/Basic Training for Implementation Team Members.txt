Important note on Balance files:
Adjustment Type ID:
It can be Fixed Amount or Balance Differential
Example for Fixed Amount:
Existing Balance: $100.00 Fixed Amount passed: -25,00 New Balance: $75.00 Logic: Invoice Cloud will take the provided amount and 
either add or subtract
 it from the current balance due based on whether it is a positive or negative amount
Example of Balance Differential
Existing Balance: $100.00 Balance Differential passed: 25,00 New Balance: $25.00 Logic: Invoice Cloud will take the provided amount and 
replace
 it with the balance currently on file. If $100.00 is the current balance and $25.00 is passed, $25.00 is now the new balance.
7
A BAF should be sent to IC daily, while a biller who uses Real Time Data Refresh the balance is updated when an account is accessed. (Real Time Data Refresh is a service which allows Invoice Cloud to update the balances of invoices in our system in near-real-time.)
