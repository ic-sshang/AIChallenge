Well-named tests contribute to code readability, maintainability, and overall test suite effectiveness. 
Test Fixture Naming
A test fixture represents a class or component being tested.  Name your test fixtures consistently.
[NameOfClassBeingTested]Tests
c#
[TestFixture]
public class ShoppingCartTests
{

}
Expressive Test Names
A good name should clearly convey the purpose of the test.  Use descriptive names that explain what the scenario or behavior the test covers.  Use underscores to separate the what from the result expectation.
c#
[Test]
public void CalculateTotal_ShouldReturnCorrectAmount()
{
  /* ... */
}
