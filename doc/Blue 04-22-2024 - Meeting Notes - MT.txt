Notes
Third Party Certificates
(Client Certs)
ApplePay cert expires every year and we end up with a urgent work stream to rotate the certificate.
What format cert / types do we have?
GooglePay as a application reference for implementation.
Use Key Vault
centralize storage (store as a actual certificate in the key vault not as a secret blob)
alert on proactive expirations
phase 1 (heritage): provide certificate from key vault to deployment pipelines and inject into artifact
phase 2 (heritage): update applications to read from the key vault directly on startup and pull the cert, cache and TTL
phase 1 (Next Gen): Certificates provided from CIS key vault driver injected to into ENV 
IC.Serilog
 latest
 
During the K8s migration effort we added the ability to pass in the Log Level to allow for the usage of different 
Serilog Log Levels
 in Application Source Code, such as 
Verbose
.  Previous 
IC.Serilog
 was hard coded to 
Information
, and that is the default if no value is specified 
Configure
 method of the 
IC.Serilog
 package.
Note the last time I checked, NewRelic had a Global Log Filter that filtered out any Log with the Level of 
Debug
 or contained 
Debug
 in the message.
