In EQP Automation test cases, there are 2 test cases to verify the Email Body of Batch Close Notifications. Currently it is validating only the static text from the body. We can update these to validate below.
Update the existing test cases to check email body shouldn’t consists of any Html Template marker e.g. 
BillerDBA
, 
PaymentTypeDesc
, 
InvoiceTypeBreakDownHTML
, 
PaymentSourceBreakDownHTML
 etc.
Update Existing method to verify SettledDate, ItemCount, NetVolume, BillerDBA etc. in the EmailBody verification method.
Update EmailQueue Model to include EmailSender and add verification of that field.
Update SettelBatch Model to include PaymentTypeDesc property and add verification for that field.
