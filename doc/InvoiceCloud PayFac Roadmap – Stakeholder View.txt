This roadmap is designed to help stakeholders understand 
what to expect in each phase (Alpha → Beta → GA)
 of InvoiceCloud’s PayFac transformation. It highlights the 
core capabilities
 that impact billers and payers most: 
onboarding, payments, funding, risk/compliance, and reporting
.
Alpha – Regulatory Baseline (1–3 Billers)
Onboarding is entirely manual: Ops keys biller data into CRM and vendor portals. Chase Screening API exists but is only Ops-triggered; there are no automated vendor integrations at this stage.
Onboarding & Compliance:
 
Manual onboarding via CRM + vendor portals; 
Ops triggers Chase Screening API and uploads evidence. 
KYC/AML/OFAC checks are run manually in vendor portals. No vendor integrations yet
Payments:
 
Chase Commerce API integration
 for core auth/capture/refund/void flows.
Pilot billers live on Chase Commerce; 
Non-Chase rails (PayPal via Hyperwallet, Mastercard RPPS/Fiserv) also settle into the Chase FBO -  providing billers with a single consolidated deposit experience.
POS → TBD. 
Amex Optblue
MO# strategy
 enforced from day one to track sub-merchant transactions.
Funding:
 
Funding Orchestrator (MVP)
: nightly NACHA file generator with audit trail.
Once-daily batch funding via NACHA from Chase Treasury 
Daily Fee Debit enforced as baseline settlement model
Support Gross only
Good fund model to be introduced in Beta as an option. (T+2)
Reconciliation handled through spreadsheets → similar process as today
Discrepancy/exception report for reconciliation with uniqueID
Ledger foundation
 to support deposits, reconciliation, and future billing.
Capture CIS payment delivery status and tie back to payment. Use for 
display only
 (funding criteria based on payments, not delivery).
“Undownloaded/Unverified” + “Batch Deposit” reports for CIS exceptions
Chargeback:
Utilize existing reports for reporting
Chargeback recovery would be automated based on the configured bank accounts
Ability hold funds for rejects (TD)
ACH rejects will be disabled on ap/sp based on codes.
Hold specific failed transactions → Engineering to review this Alpha vs Beta
Risk/Compliance:
 
KYC/AML/OFAC/Underwriting checks are re-run manually in vendor portals. 
Ops also conduct manual checks, and Kount will be used for fraud alerts, utilize existing tooling/process.
Reporting:
 
Minimal; Finance relies on Chase and existing IC reports+ manual tie-outs. 
Biller-facing reports limited to reconciliation and will also re-use existing ones
{placeholder for Chase Integration Guide report guides}
Stakeholder Expectation:
Early adopters can process payments and get consolidated deposits. Onboarding is manual, reporting is basic, and operations are manual.
Notes
:
PSN Feedback: Consider 1 PSN Biller part of Alpha to enhance learning.
Timeline
: Feb 2026 (Stretch) 
Launch Timeline
: Q1 2026
Goal
: Achieve regulatory baseline. Processor integration + Funding orchestration.
Beta  – Operational Baseline (~20 Billers)
Onboarding & Compliance:
 
Biller Portal (Day-1 version):
 biller onboarding form, SF integration, invoice visibility, basic reporting.
CRM workflows; API-driven KYC/OFAC persisted in CRM/New Biller Portal; 
Chase Screening surfaced via Ops dashboard.
Payments:
 
Expand Commerce processing for ~20 billers. Perform necessary system fine tuning. 
Amex routing 
TBD
: OptBlue the preferred path, with some cohorts remaining on legacy aggregator until GA. 
Ops/Finance dashboards
 for payouts and exceptions.
Funding:
 
Automated nightly 
Funding Orchestrator
 with gates option (Approved, CIS confirmed, deposit delay met, sufficient FBO balance); Daily debit +
 Monthly invoicing
Gross only
Block funding option
 if 
sent_to_cis_at
 is missing. Ops dashboards for eligibility/exceptions.
Risk/Compliance:
 
KYC/OFAC failure queues managed in CRM; reserves schema logged for audit only (not enforced at Beta); exception handling workflows live in Ops/Compliance.
Reporting:
 Ops/Finance dashboards reconciling payouts to Chase confirmations, with CSV extracts for Finance continuity. IC becomes the primary reporting source for billers.
Stakeholder Expectation:
Smoother and faster onboarding, predictable daily deposits, and access to early exception dashboards. Operations are still maturing but usable at scale for ~20 billers.
Timeline
: July 2026 (Stretch) 
Note: Iterative development and delivery
Launch Timeline
: Q3 2026
Goal
: Ops can run without chaos, first signs of scalability.
GA  – Scale & Optimization (100+ Billers)
Onboarding & Compliance:
 Full self-service onboarding wizard; automated re-KYC schedules.
Funding:
 risk-tiered deposit delays;
Risk/Disputes:
 Advanced fraud/AML dashboards; automated chargeback workflows with evidence retention.
Reporting & Tax:
 Real-time portal for billers (transaction lifecycle → settlement → funding); multi-rail ledger; automated 1099-K generation via vendor.
Stakeholder Expectation:
Scalable PayFac platform supporting 100+ billers. Faster payouts, expanded payment rails, full self-service onboarding, and transparent reporting/chargeback handling.
Timeline
: TBD -
Goal
: Scale, efficiency, compliance at volume.
Key Decisions Impacting Roadmap
Amex strategy
 (OptBlue vs. direct aggregator).
POS device migration
 (Bluefin support vs. Chase POS).
Timeline Summary
Alpha:
 Sep – Feb 2026→ Pilots live & reconciled.
Beta:
  July 2026 → Operational baseline for ~20 billers.
GA:
 TBD → Scaled platform with 100+ billers, advanced monitoring/dashboards, and other future states
