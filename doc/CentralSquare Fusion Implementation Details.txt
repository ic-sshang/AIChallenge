Central Square: Autopay Conversion
For all new Central Square implementations, the Implementation Manager (IM) 
must tell the biller to remove converted autopay's from their Central Square system
. InvoiceCloud (IC) will manage these going forward.
If autopay information isn't removed from Central Square:
Billers 
must manually delete pending payments
 in Central Square after 
each
 billing cycle (even multiple cycles a month).
Only after this step can billers delete bank files from processing out of Central Square.
Crucially, not following this process leads to a high risk of double drafting accounts.
