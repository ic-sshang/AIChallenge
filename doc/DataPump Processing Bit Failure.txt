Log query result is > 0.0 on ‘Datapump Processing Bit Failure’
Description
DataPump alerts through a New Relic log, indicating the Datapump.exe run failed to update the processing bit for billers. The list of billers are indicated in the DataPumpMonitor alert that will come in within a few minutes or less.
Common Scenarios
An uncaught exception is not being handled, erroring out DataPump before updating the processing bit.
There is an issue with the app server from the alert, unexpected causing stuck billers.
Steps to Resolve
Go to the biller’s shard and search for tables 
DataPump
 and 
BillerDataPump
. 
You could also go to the biller portal and check the 
BillerSyncHistoryDataPump
 page or in the CRM’s 
DataPump Prod Billers 2 Min Delay
 page in the 
Reporting
 tab.
Look up all records in 
DataPump
 to see if they have a 
DateDelivered
.
Ex. For 10 stuck payments, check if these 10 are being updated.
Check the DataPump.DateDelivered fields every minute or so to see if these are getting updated.
If no payments are being updated and the BillerDatapump.Processing has not been updated, the processing bit will need to be reset. 
Go to the CRM under Tools/DataPumpProcessingManagement. 
Select the billers that are needing to be reset.
Confirm payments are posting or the processing bit is being updated consistently.
