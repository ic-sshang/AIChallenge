Unclear on the commit dates here.  We weren’t even engaged with the providers until early- to mid-April.  The plan was to begin development in Q2 and deliver in Q3, which is still the goal for Q3.
POC development was completed in mid-May as part of the discovery effort.
Selecting the Identity Provider was finalized on June 24th with pricing negotiations happening beyond that.

 Retrospective
Collaborate together on what the team should Start doing, Stop doing, and Keep doing. The PM/Tech Lead/Designer should add items to the table below in advance of the meeting. We'll use these to talk about how we can improve our process going forward.
Start doing
Stop doing
Keep doing
PRISM/PULSE:
Automation with all the feature stories, currently the automation is increasing the required effort by around 50% and keeping it that way will slow down the implementions. 
To cover Automation anyway, can we think of a separate team just for Automation of the Test Cases.
PRISM/PULSE:
Sprint Demos, which is a new practice implemented with the PRISM and PULSE teams.
BMS:
Provide delivery commitments after Discovery concludes (less overlap)
Bring in other teams earlier to avoid potential blockers
Implement regular Sprint Demos
BMS:
Proceeding without clear delivery commitments during active Discovery phases
BMS:
Refining discovery process to define requirements earlier in process
Monitoring usage and feedback post-release to better prioritize future work
 Discovery
Provide a list of discovery items, both product and technical, that will be discovered over the next quarter. Link to Jira Product Discovery.
