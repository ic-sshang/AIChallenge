Summary
It is best practice to introduce the customer to the support process as the project is nearing its go-live. Depending on the size and characteristics of the customer, Invoice Cloud applies a tiered support model.
The document linked here 
Go Live Overview_InvoiceCloud
 is the Go-Live overview that can be shared with the client.  
It is also best practice to ensure the CRM (Integration Summary) correclty reflects the project and integartion details. Every field of that page should be documented at go-live. 
Process
1. Review if your project will get a Technical Support Manager (TSM) / Technical Account Manager (TAM) assigned or not. The Client Services team reviews this list every week to assign a TSM. Whenever the target go-live date is populated the biller shows up on the list, and the CS team decides who should be the TSM/TAM. Usually, Enterprise billers get a TSM assigned by the TSM team. Aside from thresholds, if the IM/PM feels that things are not going so well, CS can certainly take the biller in for TSM, regardless of MRR.  Talk to a CS leader if you have questions.
This is the list CS follows in Salesforce to review TSM assignments -

Transition Process for projects with a “Phased-Approach” go live: 
Background
: Some billers, mostly insurance companies, go live in phases.  The implementation team stays engaged for a period to release new invoice types or products. The CS team oversees supporting the products or invoices that are in production. The challenge is that the client expects IC to have a consolidated front for support.  They expect all IC issues (new implementation or production issues) to be handled by the same group of people.
To offer excellent service and appear to the client as one department of service, IC will extend the Implementation team to cover support issues. 
What is a “phased approach” project: 
A project where some or all this criterion is met:
Steering Co meetings are still happening on a regular basis
RAID log is active
New revenue coming in future phases (new invoice ID or new products like Autopay)
Likely, a new project was provisioned to handle the new phase.
The project with the previous phase was archived in SmartSheet
