Random Thoughts/Music Request
Group meeting when multiple testers are testing an item to get aligned +1
Test case count/limit/threshold to determine if a group of testers will be required?
Maybe create matrix?
That’ll be helpful
Reviewing Gong calls on items when they’re provided. +1
Test both payment types - ACH and CC - when testing payment route changes.
Also on development
Test negative scenarios where applicable
Postman workspace?? +1
Love that idea!
We mentioned this in a previous sprint retro, it just hasn’t came to fruition. : fingersnap :
I could try making one. I’m in postman a lot rn -Kate 
Make sure all the code added is stepped over when developing/testing
Having items/tasks ready for devs to start on.
Grooming?
More info and insight when leaving for FTO and leaving outstanding items to other team members.
Create base test cases f.i. for paymentMethod pages have a base of required tests
Perhaps we could also have QA run existing automation for that page as well
We could kick it off ourselves we just need to know what they have 
Add to the channel (please) 
List of test pipelines which we execute during regression, these can be executed in devtest
Test pipelines
 - 
Pipeline for regression runs - Engineering Excellence - Quality Engineering - Confluence
..
Tags used in the automation suite to run a specific test suites 
- 
Tag Definitions for QE Automation Tests - Engineering Excellence - Quality Engineering - Confluence
Thank you! +1
Plan and estimate work better* to avoid last minute scrambling (eg: SFB user persona)
Focusing on wiki during reviews.
Changing implementation midway - minimize rework by aligning on an approach early and sticking to it (thorough grooming and clarity in solution ahead is critical) (eg: logging item) +1
Thorough ticket grooming for testing - ensure test cases are well defined during grooming to catch issues early and prevent failures in regression (logging item again)
Working hard
Closing items
Testing Items
Great job pushing through and delivering all SFB items for their go-live. :💪
👏👏👏

Movie/TV series recommendations?
We started Paradise last night on Hulu, pretty good

Any update(s) on the new team logo?
We got an IC Swag store now! 
 
I like the backpack
I have one, it’s the old logo, want it?  I never use it!
😮 
More Blink-182! 
 
New stuff is pretty good
