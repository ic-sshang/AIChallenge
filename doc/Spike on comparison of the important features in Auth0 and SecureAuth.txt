Objective
This technical spike evaluates 
Auth0
 and 
SecureAuth
 focusing on:
Multi-Tenant Identity Management
 (via 
Organizations
)
Password Expiry and Complexity Policies
 required by 
PCI-DSS 4.0
The comparison addresses how each platform supports user segmentation, policy enforcement, compliance alignment, and administrative control. The aim is to determine which solution best fits Organizations security, compliance, and architectural requirements.
Definitions
Organizations
A logical grouping of users, applications, and authentication policies within an identity platform.
Use Cases Include:
Multi-Tenancy: Supporting multiple customers in one identity system
B2B SSO: Allowing partners to authenticate using their IdP (e.g., SAML, OIDC)
Internal Segmentation: Managing access per business unit, department, or region
Custom Branding: Different UI or policies for each organization
PCI-DSS 4.0 Password Policies
A set of data security standards for organizations handling cardholder information. Key requirements include:
Password expiration every 90 days
Minimum password length (12 characters)
Complexity requirements
Password reuse restrictions
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Session timeout and audit logging
