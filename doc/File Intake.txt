(refer to diagram)
.
Additional documentation of the top 5 main components of the

File(s) in general includes:
Zip
PDF
Regular files (BIF, BAF, CUF, TXT, etc.)
Note: 
Blue 
- here represents a code repository
File(s) sources
.  Billers or IC internal users uploading files from the following point/source.  Each source has different limitations of what kind of file a user can upload:
Stratus Client
 
- a Windows Form executable that the end user installed from IC package location.
FTP Client 
- any third-party FTP client or executable like FileZilla
CloudInvoicing 
- part of Biller Portal (MyIIS solution)
CRM 
- internal use only and accept “Regular files” only (no zip)
Other Repositories involved in file intake
 - included here are statuses of current (as of 4/26/2024) Code Coverage and Unit Test.  The first 5 repositories are main components of processing an Invoice File.

Diagram
This diagram shows a high level process of files from the time that a user upload all the way to the final stage (considered “completed” or “failed”).  The diagram also shows components that 
does not exists in lower/development environment
, it also shows if a component is a 
code repository
.   Big thanks to 
 and 
 for your inputs.
