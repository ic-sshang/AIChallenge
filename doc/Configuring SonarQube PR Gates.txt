Add build validation policy to the main branch to ensure that the build pipeline runs
Configure the DevOps integration for the project in SonarQube
Open a PR to main branch. This should trigger a build from the PR rather than from a branch.
note
: if you have an existing PR, the validation won't show up, even if you update the PR. Maybe it would if you push a new commit - need to test this. Definitely shows up if you open a new PR.
After the PR run completes, add the Sonar status check to the main branch’s policies.
