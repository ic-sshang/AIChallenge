Important Implementation/Accelerator Customizations
Pay by Text is an addition to the accelerator that is required to be coded in by the Biller. 
Last 4 Digits of CC/ACH for Payments is an addition to the accelerator that is required to be coded in by the Biller.
UserType and UserLogName in the Autopay webservice call is an additional value that needs to be added to the accelerator if the biller would like to receive these values. This is an Advanced Setting that will need to be setup for the Biller.  
03-06-2025 When un-enrollment of autopay would pass “
PaymentType = 0
", this change is not part of the accelerator. Please advice the biller to code for the responses to consume PaymentType = 0 on their own implementation. IC is evaluating the enhancement to the accelerator for 04/2025 enhancement list.
