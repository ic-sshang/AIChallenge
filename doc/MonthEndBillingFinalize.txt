Overview
Job Configuration
The job is run by users of the CRM.   It has a Skybot job configuration but it is not designed to be run via the Skybot scheduler.   Instead it is invoked via a call to the IC Business Service from the CRM.  This call will set a transient ENVIRONMENT variable 
MONTHENDCONFIGID
.  The presence of 
MONTHENDCONFIGID
 allows the business logic in the job to run.
