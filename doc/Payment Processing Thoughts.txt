(L) Unify the batch close models by migrating "auto close" Billers to the "custom batch close" model.  
Review performance, scalability, and elasticity of custom batch close model to understand impact of having more Billers on it
Sunset the old auto close model including archival of jobs and updating crm
VALUE - One model to support, with greatly improved scalability and elasticity
(L) Offline Payment Processing
When Chase is down, or any processor, we are blocked from processing with that processor.  
When the processor is down, save the pending transaction information, queue it for processing, and when the processor is back, send the transaction through
VALUE - Ability to take payments when processors are down
(L) Payment Processor Realtime Routing
If a processor is down, is there a backup processor that is set up for the Biller that we can use?  If so, send the transaction through them.
VALUE - Ability to take payment when main Biller processor is down
(S) Implement a "batch-settled" event enabling downstream processes to react if needed
The biggest user of this event could be the payment export process.  When INT team is ready to update their ftp export process to trigger after a batch close they can simply start listening for those events from that queue
When we settle a batch, write out an item to a new storagequeue/servicebus
VALUE - Downstream processes can be aware of when a batch closes and can react off that in real time
(S) Chase Processing Alternate API URL
I believe Chase has said previously that in cases of downtime we should call an alternate processing center/url.  Right now for "live" we just use the ws1 url.
Not sure how the pending orbital migration changes this
VALUE - Improved resiliency (if Chase is actually right)
