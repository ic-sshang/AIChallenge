Biller has Owner, Renter and Billing records - the following logic should be in place (using the ORB column) when the invoice details are sent to Invoice Cloud:
If Billing (B) is present, Billing (B) should be displayed.
If Billing (B) is not present and Renter (R) is present, Renter (R) should be displayed.
If Billing (B) is not present and Renter (R) is not present, Owner (O) should be displayed.

note
Note: The adjustment file can and will contain duplicate records for the same account. Please create logic such that duplicates are ignored in the file. It does not matter which record is used to process the adjustment, as both have the same adjustment amount.
IC supports 
two
 versions of this file:
Trim leading zeros on ACCOUNT/AccountNumber
No changes to ACCOUNT/AccountNumber
IM will need to alert IT which import type to use when submitting the coding request (this should match the same AccountNumber format as the invoice file so that adjustments are applied properly)
