Design the API contract (e.g., endpoints, HTTP methods, request/response schemas).
Create models for the API request and response.
Service Implementation
Objective
: Implement the service to interact with Azure OpenAI.
Tasks
:
Implement authentication for the biller persona
Create a service class to handle communication with Azure OpenAI.
Implement methods to send prompts and receive responses from OpenAI.
Handle authentication using the API key.
Testing
Objective
: Ensure the API works as expected.
Tasks
:
Write unit tests for individual components.
Implement integration tests for API endpoints.
Perform end-to-end testing to validate the entire workflow.
Biller GraphQL API Project Plan
GraphQL Schema Design
Objective
: Define the GraphQL schema.
Tasks
:
Identify the types and queries needed.
Create schema definition files.
Implement schema validation.
Data Layer Implementation
