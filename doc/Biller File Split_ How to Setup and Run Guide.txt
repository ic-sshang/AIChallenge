Setup FTP
In the FTP Management tab, confirm the the FTP credentials have been set up if not, click the “click here to set up new credentials” link.
Then click the New FTP User option.

Set up FTP Import  - File Settings
In the FTP Management tab, navigate to FTP Import Processing
Click Available Files and select/drag the file formats you need per file type.
Then click New File Setting, and configure the settings. 
The paths must specify 
YOUR

: When you set up available files, then the options will become available in the File Settings format options.
Set up BillerFileSplit project in the AVD
Repo: 
BillerFileSplit
Branch: Depends. 
main, main32, or BFS64BitPipelineBranch
In the solution, add the command line arguments: 
-maxthreads=1
. 
Alternatively, change directly in the code: 
Dim MaxThreads As Integer = 2
Replace 
GetDebugBillerList 
method, with a method similar to the one below. Make sure the  Replace has the correct biller and personal path portion. Here we are attempting to use the configuration for the biller using our personal FTP.
Module1.vb
vb
Public Function GetDebugBillerList() As BillerProcessList
    Dim list As New BillerProcessList
    'Dim lookupPath As String = My.Settings.CityofNorfolkLookup.Replace("cityofnorfolk", "rruizFTP")
    'Dim invPath As String = My.Settings.CityofNorfolkInvoices.Replace("cityofnorfolk", "rruizFTP")
    'Dim adjPath As String = My.Settings.CityofNorfolkAdjustments.Replace("cityofnorfolk", "rruizFTP")
    'Dim customerUpdPath As String = My.Settings.CityOfNorfolkCustomerUpdate.Replace("cityofnorfolk", "rruizFTP")
    'list.Add(New BillerConfig("City of Norfolk", 2304, 122, lookupPath, invPath, adjPath, customerUpdPath))
    'commented code is just another way of doing the same.

    list.Add(New BillerConfig(
             "City of Norfolk",
             2304,
             122,
             My.Settings.CityofNorfolkLookup.Replace("cityofnorfolk", "rruizFTP"),
             My.Settings.CityofNorfolkInvoices.Replace("cityofnorfolk", "rruizFTP"),
             My.Settings.CityofNorfolkAdjustments.Replace("cityofnorfolk", "rruizFTP"),
             My.Settings.CityOfNorfolkCustomerUpdate.Replace("cityofnorfolk", "rruizFTP")))
    Return list
End Function
Also please change 
GetCustomBillerListDebug
 to the following:
vb
Public Function GetCustomBillerListDebug() As BillerProcessList
    Return GetDebugBillerList()
End Function
BillerProcessList.vb
Replace the information in the else statement with
'constructor
Public Sub New(_billerDBA As String, _billerID As Integer, _integratorID As Integer, _fileLookupDirectory As String, _bifLoc As String, Optional _bafLoc As String = "", Optional _cufLoc As String = "", Optional _pdfSplit As Boolean = False, Optional _invoiceTypeID As Integer? = Nothing, Optional _alternativeProcess As Integer = 0, Optional _ConveyanceLoc As String = "", Optional _iufLoc As String = "")
    BillerDBA = _billerDBA
    BillerID = _billerID
    IntegratorID = _integratorID
    FileLookupDirectory = ConvertFilePathToBaseDrive(_fileLookupDirectory)
    BIFLocation = ConvertFilePathToBaseDrive(_bifLoc)
    BAFLocation = ConvertFilePathToBaseDrive(_bafLoc)
    CUFLocation = ConvertFilePathToBaseDrive(_cufLoc)
    ConveyanceLocation = ConvertFilePathToBaseDrive(_ConveyanceLoc)
    IUFLocation = ConvertFilePathToBaseDrive(_iufLoc)
    Me.PDFSplit = _pdfSplit
    InvoiceTypeID = _invoiceTypeID
    AlternativeProcess = _alternativeProcess
End Sub
For safety reasons, in 
GetBillerListForEnvironment
 comment out the else statement where active biller configurations are retrieve.
Important Notes
: Make sure you read the code, and place break points in areas of high risk or importance. You are solely responsible of what happens when you run code locally.
Additionally, be 
very cautious
 with any logic relating to 
conveyance 
to avoid any issue in production. Be sure to read and understand what the code does.
Before proceeding to run the code make sure you place the right files in the correct locations to ensure the process runs as expected. This can be accomplished using File-Zilla.

Once you set up File-zilla, proceed to connect to your FTP, and locate the start of the file path
Click into it, and create the missing directory in the expected location. Use the “Create Directory” option
Confirm the directory has been created. After this you should be able to add the Fille Settings.
