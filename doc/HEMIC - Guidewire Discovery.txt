Considerations
 Internal Notes
   
Response/Decision Date
How are quote payments captured?  Is the billing account number or policy number known at this time?  If yes, consider creating the account before a BIF arrives or creating one on the fly.  If no, consider using the Customer Renewal function later to move the Quote Number over to the actual billing/policy number.
 User -> account(unique) -> policy(unique) ”invoices”
Typically 1 account - 1 policy
Insured can have 2 open invoices.
 
Agent payments - do the agents need to act on the behalf of the policyholder for payments?  If yes, consider using Agent Connect without a LoginGUID.
 N/A
 
Agency payments - do the agency pay with their own agency payment method?  If yes, consider using Agent Connect with a LoginGUID and user role of Account Oversight or Group Oversight.  In order to prevent long lists of linked accounts, it is recommended to link the account to the user and unlink after the transaction is complete.
N/A 
 
How are renewals handled - will the billing system call our Customer Renewal API? (i.e., does the policy/account number change every policy term? If so, call the API)
 
 
Is multi-user needed?  Are the additional users co-owners (LoginType 5), or Oversight (LoginTypes 3&4).  For Plan Administration, consider LoginType 4 - Group Oversight - as well as how Option 122 should be configured.  Group Oversight should stay registered even if the policyholder is unregistered.
 N/A
 
How is billing handled? Policy Based, Account Based or Both? 
(This will decide on what the IC account number will be) 
Tell us about how your quote system works and the issuance process of quotes/policies
 
 
How many phases will there be for go live?
