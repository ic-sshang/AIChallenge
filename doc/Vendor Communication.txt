Create a repository of all vendors. Where this should be maintained
What should be the name of the DL
SRE Operations and the product team should watch the DL
SRE Operations will create a Jira ticket in the new project SRE and will track any work item that comes out of the notification.
Today, there is no centralized operations team that shouldn’t stop us from establishing a separate function. The first step would be that the eSRE WT member in the Triage/DS team will watch the DL.
