InvoiceCloud Enhances Security & Efficiency with Multi-Factor Authentication and Single Sign-On for Billers
[Boston, MA] – [March 5, 2025] – InvoiceCloud, a leading provider of secure, cloud-based digital bill payment solutions, today announced the launch of advanced security features, including 
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all users at no cost
 and 
Single Sign-On (SSO) as a premium feature
, ensuring a more secure and seamless authentication experience. 
As cyber threats continue to evolve, billers require modern authentication tools to protect their organizations and their customers. InvoiceCloud’s new MFA capabilities enhance security by requiring users to verify their identity using a variety of authentication methods, including SMS, email, and authenticator apps—at no additional charge. 
For enterprise billers seeking even greater security and efficiency, InvoiceCloud’s 
premium SSO feature
 enables seamless integration with leading identity providers, including Okta, Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD), Google Workspace, and Ping Identity. This empowers organizations to streamline user access while strengthening security protocols.
“Security is top of mind for our billers, and SSO is a game-changer,”

“With InvoiceCloud’s SSO, we can effortlessly onboard new employees and instantly revoke access when someone leaves, ensuring our customers’ data remains protected at all times.”
Beyond access management, InvoiceCloud’s SSO solution takes efficiency a step further by allowing billers to 
map roles and permissions directly to their organization’s identity provider attributes
, ensuring employees are granted the appropriate permissions from day one. This 
reduces IT burden, eliminates manual user provisioning errors, and enhances compliance
 with internal security policies.
“We are committed to providing billers with the most secure and user-friendly authentication options available,” said Steve Schult, Chief Product Officer at InvoiceCloud. “With MFA now available at no charge and SSO delivering seamless enterprise-grade access control, we’re making it easier than ever for billers to protect their data and enhance user management.”
