Background on why the IC.Azure.KeyVault does not work on Az Functions
We found this out by working on an item that utilizes a NuGet package that utilizes the Azure KeyVault. The only way this worked was by upgrading the Azure Function to V4, which is .net 6.
We were able to resolve the KeyVault issue by leveraging an out-of-the-box solution for the Azure Functions, using KeyVault references in the configuration section. 
Documentation on KeyVault references

Solution
The solution is to utilize environment variables. The Az Functions will read configuration settings via environment variables.
