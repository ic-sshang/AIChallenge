Research Goals
To understand how users discover, navigate, and retrieve information across the platform, and to evaluate how a unified QuickFind search experience can enhance task efficiency, reduce friction, and support confident decision-making
Supporting Objectives
Identify top user tasks that involve searching across different areas of the platform (Pendo?)
Understand current 
pain points
 and workarounds in locating information (Current Biller Interviews)
Evaluate user expectations for a global or intelligent search tool (e.g., relevance, speed, filters)
Explore how QuickFind could influence user behavior, especially in onboarding, troubleshooting, and cross-feature exploration
Research Questions
What types of information do users commonly look for across the platform?
How do users currently search for or locate specific content?
Where do users struggle to find what they need?
What mental models or terminology do users expect to use in a search?
How would users evaluate the relevance, speed, and clarity of search results?
How might QuickFind change current workflows or reduce reliance on workarounds?
What additional features (filters, recent history, commands) would improve usability
Methodology
We will conduct remote moderated usability tests via Great Question with 5-8 biller users. Calls should likely be 45 minutes, and we can offer a gift card for their participation ($20). 
A series of 45-minute interviews will be held with a subset of our billers recruited from the Biller Research Panel and CSM requests. 
During the sessions, participants will be asked to go through three prototypes: basic, navigation, and side panel views while sharing their screen while they walk through the search and speak aloud their thoughts.
