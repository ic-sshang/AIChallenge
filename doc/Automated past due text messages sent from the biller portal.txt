The Problem
Today, there is no automated way for billers to send past due messages outside of emails to payers. We have a product that sends automated phone calls (Outbound IVR) but this product is infrequently used by only 8 billers. Text messages have higher response rates than email or phone calls according to IVRT, so we want to replace the outbound IVR product with automated messages. 
Why: How do we know this is a real problem and worth solving?
We know we need a replacement for outbound IVR. That product was never fully implemented and it is used by only 8 billers.
We will also need to have an automated reminder platform according to the sales team if we are to continue to sell into enterprise-sized organizations, “To be competitive in the larger accounts for this product, we need an automatic message to go out.” - Matt Braley
Phone calls also have a low response rate, while text messages have much higher response rates (up to 40% according to IVRT).

Audience: Who are we building for?
The primary audience for this product is any biller that wants to improve past due collections. There is broad applicability for a product like this across the biller base. Today, to send a reminder text we use Outbound Campaigns, but users do not want to create a custom campaign every time. 
High-level Approach
First, we need to decide what we are doing with outbound campaigns. I propose keeping outbound campaigns as a method to send ad-hoc messages to payers. The new automated text feature will only send late reminders. 
These texts will need to be customizable, similar to the way outbound IVR today is customizable. The biller will have the option to choose the invoice type for the message, the date, number of retries, and the template markers used. We will also need to develop a way to test the texts easily for the biller. 
To send the texts, we plan on using IVRTs available APIs: 
TBD
Further discussions with IVRT are necessary to determine feasibility and pricing. 
Success
How do we know if we’ve solved this problem?
We will know if we are successful based on the results we can drive for billers. We should be able to attribute payments that come from the late payment reminders so we can show the biller that we gained them revenue with this feature.
