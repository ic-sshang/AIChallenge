Alert Trigger Condition
An alert is triggered when a record in the StratusFileProcessor table has a StartedDate but no CompletedDate or CanceledDate for over 30 minutes. This indicates that files are sitting idle and not being picked up for processing.
Step-by-Step Resolution Process
Step 1: Check Pending Files
Run the following SQL query in 
IC_PerfLogging DB
 to check pending files:
SELECT TOP 1000 *
FROM StratusFileProcessor
WHERE CompletedDate IS NULL
  AND CanceledDate IS NULL
  AND MachineName LIKE '%IC-App1%'
ORDER BY 1 DESC;
Replace 'IC-App1' with the actual machine name from the alert.
Step 2: Monitor File Processing
If files are slowly getting processed, no action is needed.
If files are not moving at all, proceed to the next step.
Step 3: Investigate via Skybot
Open Skybot Job History from Prod AVD:
Locate the latest job run for the affected machine.
Download the job log and review it for errors or signs of a file causing the job to fail.
Step 4: Identify and Remove Bad File
Find the server IP from the Server List on Confluence.
In Prod AVD, open File Explorer:
Right-click → New → Shortcut
Enter: \\{IP Address} (e.g., \\10.0.6.4)
Login using your IC email and password (select 'Use a different account').
Navigate to:
   EDataAppData → Files → In → StratusPending → {file type folder}
Move the bad file to:
   Files → In → Errors
Step 5: Update the Database
Contact Data Services to manually set a CanceledDate for the bad file in the StratusFileProcessor table. Once updated, you can close the alert.
Step 6: Handle Duplicate Records (Rare Scenario)
Follow Step 4 to access the machine folder.
Check if the file exists in the queue.
If no file is present, but the record still has no dates, it’s likely a duplicate.
Contact Data Services to mark the record as canceled.
