When deploying to 
icbatchtest
 the package version in the pool is automatically updated. However, when deploying to production (
icautopay
) it does need to be manually updated to the latest version. For the ICAutoPayController, be sure to deploy to 
ControllerPool
 for production and 
ControllerPool2
 for the test environment. Also, for the APController, 
the package version needs to be set in the Job configuration task
 and is hardcoded in the command line of the Job configuration task and needs to be manually updated.
Using the 
LateFees or AutoPayment
 summary (or just checking the iclogstorage), determine how many tasks/jobs ran and ensure all summaries are accounted for (to rerun, report issues, etc.).
If an application package appears to be successfully deployed but is not available in the dropdown, check the deploy / pipeline logs to see if the package limit was reached. You may need to go into the batch account → Applications and delete old(est) package versions (obviously don’t delete the most recent ones since those are for rollback purposes).
