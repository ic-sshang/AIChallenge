Summary
As part of our post implementation process, the marketing department sends a survey to newly launched customers (new billers only). To help with the survey process, IMs/PMs need to mark the appropriate implementation contact in Salesforce as part of the post go-live steps when closing out the project.
Process
In Salesforce, navigate to the biller’s 
account
 page
Select Contacts and View all
Find (or Add) the appropriate implementation contact, click the contact to edit the profile and check the “Implementations/Project Manager” checkbox in the Functional Roles section. (You can edit the field by hitting the pencil icon next to the field.) Then hit save.
