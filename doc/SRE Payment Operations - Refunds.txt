The SRE Wicket Tendies team today takes up the Payment Operations task for the Refunds and Settlement side of things.
The DS ticket should have explicit approval from Cat/CS leadership to carry out the refunds
Approval must be noted in the comments of the DS ticket by the approver
The SRE Member will create an SR item for the refunds to capture the code change and PR details.
The PR approval from Engineering Leads is the approval to carry out the Payment Operations work
The Engineering Lead and SRE members join a Zoom call which normally happens in room #1 of the DS all-day call 
The DS ticket will be attached with the list of items that has been worked with success/failure details
Once the execution is done the SR item is closed and linked to the DS ticket and the respective tickets are resolved
Request Cutoff Time:
 3pm EST. If refund request is known prior to full details being available, CS is to alert DS in the ds-escalations slack channel.
