This guide helps developers:
Define a clear AI use case.
Assess the use case to determine the appropriate tools and components.
Integrate AI into products or internal engineering workflows using our standard toolchain.
Defining an AI Use Case
Identify the Problem
Ask:
What task is repetitive, time-consuming, or error-prone?
What decision-making process could benefit from intelligent assistance?
What data do we have that could be leveraged?
Example
: "We want to summarize customer support tickets to reduce triage time."
Define the Objective
Be specific about the outcome:
What should the AI do?
What does success look like?
Example
: "Generate a 2-sentence summary of each ticket with key issue and urgency."
Understand the Input and Output
Input
: What data or user input will the AI receive?
Output
: What should the AI return?
Example
:
Input: Raw text from support tickets.
Output: Concise summary in natural language.
Determine Constraints
Real-time vs batch?
Accuracy requirements?
Does context need to persist over long running use case?
Privacy or compliance concerns?
PII and PCI data compliance policies must be observed
Assessing the Use Case Against Available Tools
Use This Decision Tree
Is this for a 
product or customer-facing application
?
Yes
 → Use Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Foundry via:
Chat Completions SDK for direct prompt/response.
Semantic Kernel SDK for multi-step workflows or agent-based logic.
Is this for 
internal engineering productivity
?
Yes 
→ Do you want to integrate the tool into VS Code?
Yes
 → Use Model Context Protocol tools (MCP).
If an MCP tool already exists, configure it in VS Code.
If not, create one using the .NET 8 MCP SDK.
No
 → You are building a standalone developer tool.  Refer to the above for creating a product application.  Your customer is a developer.
