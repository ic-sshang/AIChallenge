Note: this guide is specifically for BillerFileSplit Failure alerts. If you are dealing with an Overrun alert, just monitor the job in skybot and make sure it completes successfully.
Background Information
BillerFileSplit is a process that splits raw files into smaller individual files. Depending on the integration, a raw file can be split into any combination of invoices, adjustments, customer updates, invoice updates, and conveyance files. BFS runs based on entries in the itg.BillerFileSplit table in DBMaster_GoldAzure. The LookupPath is where BFS looks for raw files, and the other paths are where it spits out the resulting files. Billers that use BFS will have FTP Import tasks that scan the output folders to pick up the split files.
BillerFileSplit alerts can come from a couple different skybot jobs. Currently, most billers run in the 
BillerFileSplit
 job, but there are still a couple that run on a legacy job called 
STAGING-BillerSplitFile-Custom-64
. This custom job runs off of an old branch of BillerFileSplit, and does not use the database entries in itg.BillerFileSplit. 
Description
BillerFileSplit can fail for a variety of reasons. 
The raw file was empty
The raw file was corrupted during FTP transfer
The raw file was cut off during the FTP transfer
The biller sent a bad file
BillerFileSplit was misconfigured
The file was too big (this doesn’t happen anymore after the move to 64bit)
etc.
When the skybot job fails, it will trigger an alert. The alert will have the name of the job, the run number, and a copy of the logs.
Resolution
Regardless of the issue with the file, the best course of action is to move the file out of the LookupPath and into a separate Errors\ folder so that BillerFileSplit will not attempt to process it again. Look at the skybot job logs to see which biller failed, and where the file is sitting.
Some integrations (ex: PCI) will automatically move the file into an Errors folder on failure.
Once you move the file out of the lookup folder, you can review the logs to determine where the issue occurred and why. If the issue was caused by the file (and not by bad code), you should report the problem in #production-ops and request that they reach out to the biller to fix the file. 
If you can’t tell why the file failed from the logs, you may need to run BFS locally to debug the issue. If you have questions or need help, please reach out to the team.
Steps to run BillerFileSplit
Clone the BillerFileSplit repo
In Module1.vb, replace the GetBillerList() function with the following code:
vb
Public Function GetBillerList() As BillerProcessList
    Dim lookup As String = "C:\Users\IanSwitzer\Downloads\alert\lookup"
    Return New BillerProcessList() From {
        New BillerConfig(
            _billerDBA:="BFS TEST",
            _billerID:=2899,
            _integratorID:=122,
            _fileLookupDirectory:=lookup,
            _bifLoc:=$"{lookup}\inv",
            _bafLoc:=$"{lookup}\adj",
            _iufLoc:=$"{lookup}\iuf",
            _cufLoc:=$"{lookup}\cuf",
            _ConveyanceLoc:=$"{lookup}\ccf",
            _alternativeProcess:=1
        )
    }
End Function
Replace 
lookup
 with your local folder path
Create the necessary subfolders within the lookup folder (inv/adj/cuf/iuf/ccf)
Change the 
_billerID
 to the biller that you want to run BFS for
Change the 
_integratorID
 to the partner ID for the biller
If the integration uses 
alternativeProcess
 to determine which kind of task to run, set this to 0 or 1 (ex: PCI). If it doesn’t use that variable, you can remove it. 
In Module1.vb, set MaxThreads to 1 on line 20.
Set breakpoints in Module1.vb, as well as in the integration that you want to debug. 
Place the raw file in your local lookup folder.
Run the project!
BillerFileSplit will take the raw file and spit out the split files in the output folders that you provided.
