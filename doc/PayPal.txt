Common PayPal issues: 
The transaction amount of PayPal payments are including the convenience fee in the total amount for split model billers. This issue can be found in DataPump, Payment Exports, Payment Reports, Etc… 
Explanation: 
“This occurs due to PayPal’s one-transaction requirement. This issue doesn’t occur with other split model payment types as they are inserted into the database as the payment amount and convenience fees are inserted as their own payment records.
The stored procedure that returns these payments will subtract the convenience fee from the payment amount. Since the payment amount and convenience fee are in their own payment record the convenience fee will always be 0.00 for the payment amount record and the convenience fee will reflect in the convenience fee column.
For example:
A Visa payment of 10 dollars was made with a convenience fee of 2 dollars.
In our database, we will see the following payment records
PaymentType
Payment Amount
Convenience Fee
Visa
2.00
2.00
Visa
10.00
0.00
The stored procedure will check if the terminal is a submitter and since this biller is enabled we will then do the following:
2.00-2.00 = 0.00 – do not add to the report
10.00 - 0.00 = 10.00 - add 10.00 payment amount to the report
The convenience fee will be 0.00 and the transaction total will be 10.00
PayPal payment with required single transaction example:
A PayPal payment of 15 dollars was made with a convenience fee of 5 dollars.
In our database, we will see the following payment record
PaymentType
Payment Amount
Convenience Fee
PayPal
20.00
5.00
The stored procedure will check if the terminal is a submitter and since this biller is enabled we will then do the following:
20.00 - 5.00 = 15.00 - add 15.00 payment amount to the report
The convenience fee will be 5.00 and the transaction total will be 20.00”
In these cases, you’ll need to make sure that the integration/ logic that is not splitting the payment amount is in fact not splitting the convenience fee from the transaction amount then submit an ITG item for the integration.
