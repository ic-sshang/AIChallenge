Embed contextual KB content on each BP page
HIGH
HIGH
Create an integration between the IC system and SC KB such that each page would dynamically include relevant help content for the features/functions available on that page.  This will take dedicated design and development time from IC engineering resources.
On roadmap for 2024, but design/scope is still TBD
Add KB search and content to RC
MED
LOW
There’s an existing Pendo/SF integration option that’s entirely built by Pendo (for a price), and would allow for the embedding of a search into the resource center.  
Discussions have started, on Ryan to pick it back up and complete it.
Move link to SC to top-level menu
MED
MED
Proposal is to add link to SC to menu, ideally at the top level.  This would require solving the SSO jump complications.  There may be a menu-centric project gaining momentum, so perhaps this could be looped into that.

Utilize Pendo to create SC awareness
MED
LOW
Proposal is to utilize Pendo to remind users that SC exists and what it’s for.  We’ve done this in the past.  We want to be careful that we’re not using popup guides so much that it results in user fatigue.
No movement yet on new guides
Add SC jump point to BP homepage
LOW
LOW
Proposal is to copy (or move?) the SC button (which triggers SSO jump) to the biller portal homepage.  It’s a small footprint item, so we could do so without much interruption, but I’d first want to understand our larger homepage strategy before we make any changes.

Embed KB content on BP homepage
LOW
MED
Proposal is to embed SC directly in homepage.  This is a more intrusive change, and assumes we want SC to be featured in BP more than anything else.  Again, would want to establish full homepage strategy before making this change.
No movement yet
Embed KB content in BP search results
LOW
HIGH
Proposal is to utilize existing BP search function to include KB results.  There is a project proposal which would include other concepts in search results, such as customers, accounts, invoices, and payments.  Adding KB details to this list would seem to fit, but it’s a high-effort project.
