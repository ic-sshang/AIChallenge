Planning
Test Portals
IC Hosted Test Portal - 773
Biller Test Portal - Required 
The Biller will use one portal for UAT that will become the production portal. Another UAT portal should be setup ~30 days prior to go-live and will be used for post go-live UAT to introduce any new features/functions. 
Setup a biller portal login for ISI to use in the test and production biller portals
Rules of Engagement
Include ISI on all emails to the biller (ISI handles 95% of the communication regarding testing questions, virtual site updates, portal purge, etc.)
Timeline
~30 days because there is little to no work for IC. Generally, the biller is implementing ISI for the first time and IC will go-live in tandem (~6 months or longer depending on when IC is engaged). ISI will be able to provide timeline insight.
Configuration
Invoice Types
164 Insurance Premiums 
Email / Remind Me Templates
All email templates should be updated to use ‘Display Account Number’ (configure in CRM - below are a couple examples):
NOTE: This update should be made to all email templates that have this option.
Invoice Types
Ensure to configure the InvoiceTypes grid customizations to use displayaccountnumber:
Virtual Site
Although ISI is an insurance biller, they use ‘accounts' and ‘invoices' (not 'policies' and 'statements'). Site verbiage should remain with the IC generic with displayaccountnumber (as the payer never sees the value in the IC 'account number' field). ISI suggests the use of 'displayaccountnumber’ and 'zip’ for the virtual site search criteria. These two inputs should be setup as a standard.
Required Options

Option Description
Details
95
Customer Portal/Virtual Site - Show Display Account Number
If enabled, we will show the DisplayAccountNumber instead of the AccountNumber for all payer facing pages in the Virtual Site and Customer Portal. Note: This does not apply to fields from customized grids.
Enable
This option is important because ISI billers don’t use the ‘accountnumber’ value that ISI is passing. The biller and payer want to see the ‘displayaccountnumber’ value only.
108
Disable Email Address Update from BIF
If enabled, invoice file (BIF) imports will not update the customer email address. However, new emails for customers without an email address will still be inserted.
Enable – if required for integration
112
Prevent Update of Empty Account Owner Login Email After Payment
Note: 
Enable this when using Allow CC Email Updates, Prevent Email Update, and Allow Unregistered Updates.
Enable - required if Option 131 is enabled
131
Update Email Address After Payment
By default, we would allow the owner’s email addresses to be updated in the payment route if the owner’s email address is empty (
Allow email updates
).
Allow CC email updates:
 Update the CC email address when a different email is entered during the payment route. (Never update the main email address).
Prevent email updates:
 Prevent owner and CC email addresses from being overridden.
Allow unregistered updates:
 will update every time the customer is not registered.
The default value for this Option is: 
"Allow email updates"
Select appropriate action
134
Send email(s) to the payer's email address only. For the Virtual Site only.
When this option is enabled, emails will only be sent to the payer's email address (email entered in the payment route).
Enable – if required for integration

PDF URL
ISI
Depends on how far along the biller is in implementing ISI - ISI will provide as soon as they have it
ISI refers to the web service URL as the "endpoint" and the key/password the "session ID". The 
production 
password/session ID will be the same for all billers but you will need to get a specific URL/endpoint to setup the PDF Linking IT request during test (change the URL/endpoint at go-live). These are configured in CRM Advanced Settings:
Partner Coding Requirements
Setup a biller portal test login for ISI to use
Software partner requires a UAT site for all billers they being an implementation with and the test portals require to be up and functional at the beginning of the implementation.
