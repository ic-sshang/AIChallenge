Summary
 InvoiceCloud supports two versions of an integration with inHance (V1 and V2). 
The legacy/traditional inHance integration (V1) uses a ‘pull’ architecture where inHance pulls data from IC using IC web services.
The new inHance integration (V2) uses a ‘push’ architecture where IC pushes data to inHance using inHance web services (data pump).
