Upon Request
Data is specific to each biller and IC uses one file to split into new invoices, adjustments, customer updates and invoice updates
Bill Presentment
Biller
Upon Request
There is no bill presentment between IC and PCI - this will need to be setup between IC and the biller and/or the billers print vendor.
Account Types
The Biller and PCI need to advise which Account Types should be imported from the daily file. The Account Types tell IC which records to import from the file and which invoice type to map them to. There are two values in the PCI File (ArVType and InvType) that must have a specific combination to be mapped to and IC invoice type 
Example: PCI ArVType=A and InvType=1 maps to IC InvoiceTypeID=9)
Below is a low of the possible types:
The boxes in green highlight the mapping that is needed for IC Engineering to configure the mapping to import invoices. Information should be provided as follows:
ArVType = 5 and InvoiceType = P or B maps to IC Invoice Type ID = 7
ArVType = 9 and InvoiceType = R maps to IC Invoice Type ID = 8
ArVType = 95 and InvoiceType = M maps to IC Invoice Type ID = 95
