Workflow diagrams
Emily gave our team props today for our diagrams! 💖
I’m going to try implementing them during  grooming. I feel like that could have helped us out with my item if we had that at the start 🤔
We probably can request these from when we grab an item from another team +1
AutoPay is the gift that keeps on giving
Tutorial?
AI can create diagrams
this 👆 (but how meme)
I usually add copilot to make it using Mermaid and then use the Mermaid extension on Figma
We should show this at Show & Tell
I believe Sean did one on it in Bits & Bytes that’s how I learned about it
Utilize skill development time on Wednesday of new sprint
Did anyone utilize this, this week?
I forgot 😭
Block your calendar off those days with the title development learning time (or whatever)
Allocating time for Learning AI
sources you recommend?
Using the AI code review space to review y’alls PR’s before moving them forward
Not verifying if the code changes work without doing an actual test
Testing items late when in preview
Working hard!
Automation!! +1
Closing items!
Pre-grooming.
Iceland pics incoming! 
Any souvenirs?
I can give you a rock
I’ll take it lol
Have your Friday’s been meeting free yet?
So far yes
Other than standup yes
I’ll keep cancelling them as long as you guys post your updates in the team slack channel
Show recs?
If you like the comedian Shane Gillis, his show Tires is funny, I am also re-watching Big Love
Finally started It’s Florida, Man and is as crazy as Sarah said
I have a cool team AI idea/project
