Overview
This page will show you how to add additional Slack channels to IC.Slack. The SlackChannels class is a static class designed to manage mappings between an enumeration of Slack channel identifiers (SlackChannelID) and their corresponding Slack channel IDs (strings). This allows for easy reference and retrieval of Slack channel IDs within the application.
How to Add a New Slack Channel to IC.Slack
Step 1: Find the Slack Channel’s Channel ID
For the Slack desktop app, you can:
Open Slack:
 Navigate to your Slack workspace in the desktop app.
Select the Channel:
 Click on the channel whose ID you want to find.
Open Channel Details:
 Click on the channel name at the top to open the channel details.
Find the Channel ID:
 The Channel ID is usually at the bottom.
 
Step 2: Update the SlackChannelID Enum in IC.Slack
Locate the SlackChannelID Enum:
•	Open the file where the SlackChannelID enum is defined. This is typically found in the IC.Slack.Models.Enums namespace.
Add the New Channel to the Enum:
•	Add a new entry for your channel in the SlackChannelID enum. 
code example:
wide
760
namespace IC.Slack.Models.Enums
{
    public enum SlackChannelID
    {
        BMSDev,
        BMSChannel,
        NewChannel // Add this line
    }
}
Step 3: Update the SlackChannelMappings Dictionary
Open the SlackChannels Class:
•	Open the SlackChannels class file located at IC.Slack/Models/SlackChannels.cs.
Add the New Channel to the Dictionary:
•	Add a new entry to the SlackChannelMappings dictionary with the channel ID provided by Slack. For example, if the new channel ID is C1234567890:
code:
wide
760
namespace IC.Slack.Models
{
    public static class SlackChannels
    {
        private static readonly Dictionary<SlackChannelID, string> SlackChannelMappings = new Dictionary<SlackChannelID, string>
        {
            { SlackChannelID.BMSDev, "CXXXXXXXXXX" },
            { SlackChannelID.BMSChannel, "CXXXXXXXXXX" },
            { SlackChannelID.NewChannel, "C1234567890" } // Add this line
        };
    }
  }
Step 4: Use the SlackChannelID Enum in the channel object when creating a block kit.
code example:
wide
760
private string GenerateBlockKit()
{
    var postdata = new
    {
        channel = SlackChannels.GetChannelID(SlackChannelID.NewChannel),
        blocks = new object[] {
            SlackBlockKitBuilder.GenerateHeaderBlock("This is a header"),
            SlackBlockKitBuilder.GeneratePlainTextAsCodeBlockBlock("This is a text with code block"),
            SlackBlockKitBuilder.GenerateContextMarkDownBlock("This is a markdown"),
            SlackBlockKitBuilder.GenerateDividerBlock()
        }
    };
    return JsonConvert.SerializeObject(postdata);
}
Important
If your channel is private. Make sure to invite the Slack application.
Add to a Private Channel
Open the private channel.
Type 
/invite @IC Slack Bot
 just like in a public channel.
Only members of the private channel can do this.
If the app supports private channels and has the right permissions (
groups:read
 / 
groups:write
), it will join.
