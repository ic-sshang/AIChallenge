Process


Follow the checklist below in the order provided to endure a project is closed correct. Please note the difference between closures resulting from a Complete (i.e. Live) project and a Cancelled project
Project State
Steps
Complete (Live)
Ensure the Go Live date accurately reflects the date the Biller went live with the service
Ensure the IsLive checkbox is checked
When the project is ready to be closed, change the Project Status to “Complete”. Without this step complete, the project will never be archived. 
Note:
 It is expected that there may be some post-go-live activities needed before reaching Step 3. The goal is to keep this time limited as much as possible. The amount of time Live projects sit on the MPT is tracked
Cancelled (Not Live)
Ensure the IsLive checkbox is NOT checked
When the project is ready to be cancelled, change the Project Status to “Canceled”. Without this step complete, the project will never be archived.
