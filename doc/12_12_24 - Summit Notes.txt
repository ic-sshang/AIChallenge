Documentation Criteria
Laying out a template for all pages, then applying to other pages
Next steps: update for new IC brand, code connect examples
dev mode seat required for code connect
Parking lot: home/landing page – in confluence? In figma?
Documentation refinement 
Spacing/Layout: chatting through bootstrap grid behaviors , understanding grid overall
Folks didn’t initially understand the bootstrap grid and its existence throughout the product 
Next steps: creating layouts for payer side, updating spacing/layout, icons, elevation
Grouping
Discussed atomic design vs more modern systems
What’s the value in calling something like a button vs a dialog a different term?
Landed on: Foundations, Components, Patterns, Templates, Pages
Want to keep things simple and treat all components as components
Pages: we’ll have the existing versions of pages from the product, and add new components in general 
Example: payment summary updates, where new lives alongside legacy 
Improved developer handoff
Can design help in the QA process to ensure things stay closer to Figma
Leverage crit to review work more frequently 
How can we improve handoff?
Reviewing how to access devtest
Adjusting components to align vertical trim (yay!)
