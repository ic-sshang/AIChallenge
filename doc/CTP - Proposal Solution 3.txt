Create new Service dedicated to the Commerce Center API
Service - new service class
each method correspondence to an endpoint on Commerce Center 
Rest Client property, should be mockable
Models
Create models for defined objects/entities from Commerce Center
Create models for each request and response
Full unit test the new service.
Convert Request  and use new Service. Convert new Response to old Response and return.
Currently 
clsPaymenTech 
methods will:
 Accept a CTP request object
Creates a request object from Orbital Gateway
Populates the properties/fields manually one by one
Calls Orbital Gateway to process request
Creates a  CTP response object and the manually populates it with data from the response from API transaction. 
We can create Extensions for the request and response objects from Orbital Gateway, 
NewOrderRequestElement 
and 
NewOrderResponseElement 
respectively. 
These extensions will convert the the requests/responses from Orbital Gateway to one from the new Service we created. 
IDEA
c#
PaymentechGateway.PaymentechGateway oldClient;
CommerceCenterService newClient;

public CTPResponse SomeMethod(CTPRequest request, bool billerFeatureFlag)
{
    //... Created Orbital Request
    
    var orbitalResponse = billerFeatureFlag ? 
                            oldClient(orbitalRequest): 
                            newClient(orbitalRequest.ConvertToComCenReq()).ConvertToOrbitalResponse();
    //.. Continue with creating CTPResponse and populating it...
    
    return ctpResponse;
}
