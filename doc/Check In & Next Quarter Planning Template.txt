Current Quarter Commits
List out current quarter commitments that are 
 At Risk or 
 Delayed. Link to Jira items. Provide an update for each item: Why is it delayed, is there a way to pull it back to green, or do we need to reset the date. If we are resetting the date, provide the new date the team believes it can hit.

 Next Quarter: Items Under Consideration

Indicate a cut line of what you think makes it in, and your top 2-3 items out (or wherever you believe a controversial/thought-provoking line is). If you prefer, insert a Jira Plans embed below instead.
