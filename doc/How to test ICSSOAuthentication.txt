Introduction:
ICSSOAuthentication is a streamlined application that utilizes SAML SSO authentication to connect seamlessly with the InvoiceCloud website. By simplifying the login process, ICSSOAuthentication enhances user convenience and security. It enables secure access to InvoiceCloud, a comprehensive platform for managing invoices and payments, providing a seamless and productive experience for individuals, businesses, and organizations.
Resources:
“MasterClass - SAML“ in EngageSmart University
Key Features:
SAML
 (Security Assertion Markup Language) is a security 
standard
 used to exchange identitydate
SAML v2.0 is the most common standard to enable SSO with web apps today.
SAML SSO
 works by transferring a user’s identity from one place (the identity provider) to another (the service provider). This is done through an exchange of digital signed XML documents.
SAML SSO 
still relies on the “Remote Authentication” API to complete the SSO experience.
Prerequisite:
You would first need to create an account at 
https://dev-390385.okta.com/
To create an account, please get with your tech lead to get an invite to your email. Make sure to request permissions to be able to manage the applications.
under Applications > click “Invoice Cloud Demo“
Using 
BID 1505
 (
InvoiceCloud - Marcus
) or a biller setup with dev okta on CRM(Products → Cloud SSO Connect), pick a biller account that doesn’t have any emails attached to it.
We need to assign the biller account to you in Okta. Click the edit button beside your email.
under Invoice Cloud Demo > Assignments > People
Paste the account number, enter the role “Owner” and hit Save.
Depending on whether you are testing locally or in a different domain. Make sure the SAML setting matches the URL you want to hit. (Leverage PIM on Azure for temporary admin permissions to edit your HOST file on AVD to redirect 
sso.invoicecloud.com
 to your specific Devtest server if needed)
Under InvoiceCloud Demo > General > SAML Settings
example localhost (local development):
https://localhost:44392/saml_callback
example 
sso.invoicecloud.com
 (deployed to an environment):
https://sso.invoicecloud.com/saml_callback
If you want to edit. Hit edit and change it here.
https://localhost:44392/saml_callback
When changing the URL. Leave the Audience URL to sso!!!
You are ready to test (I think)!
How to Test:
Keep in mind that this is the URL format
{domain}/saml/{billerguid}?Deeplinkid=8&account={accountnumber}&ViewMode={ViewMode}
Examples:
https://test1.invoicecloud.com/saml/f3aab0bc-159a-481d-927c-62b22e618bd4?Deeplinkid=8&account=10-2014-995&ViewMode=0 
https://test1.invoicecloud.com/saml/f3aab0bc-159a-481d-927c-62b22e618bd4?Deeplinkid=8&account=10-2014-995&ViewMode=1&CssUrl=https://www.invoicecloud.com/ssotest/sso-gmp.css 
https://test1.invoicecloud.com/saml/f3aab0bc-159a-481d-927c-62b22e618bd4?Deeplinkid=8&account=10-2014-995&ViewMode=2
Field Definitions: 
Deeplinkid is the RedirectID 
BillerGUID can be found in the CRM using BillerID 1505.
Use the account number attached to your Okta account.
Pulled from ICDocumentations
Testing during local development:
Refer to the steps above for the Okta dev instance setup before proceeding. (Steps are the same whether you are within non-prod or prod network lanes only thing that changes is you will need to setup against a non-prod or prod biller and Okta SAML settings depending on your URL)
Pull ICSSOAuthentication
Make your code changes then build, and test locally.
Ensure the Okta dev instance is configured for localhost as previously mentioned.
Visit your constructed ICSSOAuthentication URL using your test biller and biller account (
https://localhost:44392/saml/f3aab0bc-159a-481d-927c-62b22e618bd4?Deeplinkid=1&account=10-2012-2063&ViewMode=0
)
 Sign in to your Okta and verify successful redirect according to your Deeplinkid
Testing against a deployed environment:
Refer to the steps above for the Okta dev instance setup before proceeding. (Steps are the same whether you are within non-prod or prod network lanes only thing that changes is you will need to setup against a non-prod or prod biller and Okta SAML settings depending on your URL)
Deploy ICSSOAuthentication to your environment(s).
Ensure the Okta dev instance is configured for your URL as previously mentioned. (Feel free to use the host file if you want to avoid changing Okta settings)
Visit your constructed ICSSOAuthentication URL using your test biller and biller account (
https://sso.invoicecloud.com/saml/f3aab0bc-159a-481d-927c-62b22e618bd4?Deeplinkid=1&account=10-2012-2063&ViewMode=0
)
 Sign in to your Okta and verify successful redirect according to your Deeplinkid
Example URLs:
Note: Refer to the steps above for the Okta dev instance setup before using these URLs. (Steps are the same whether you are within non-prod or prod network lanes only thing that changes is you will need to set up against a non-prod or prod biller and Okta SAML settings depending on your URL)
