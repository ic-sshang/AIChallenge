Invoices - New and Updates
txt
SFTP File Path: ToInvoiceCloud/DailyFiles
IC will combine TWO NFG files to create new invoices and update existing invoices. IC uses the following import processes: New Invoice Import, Update Invoice Import and Adjustment Import. The split process will include a step to store the raw MAM and Bill Print files on blob storage (CRM biller file search)

IC will receive the ‘Bill Print File’ and the ‘MAM File’
The ‘Bill Print File’ contains the majority of the data for the invoice record.
The ‘MAM File’ contains the accurate balance data to update existing records.
IC will 
hold
 the ‘Bill Print File’ and the ‘MAM File’ to process them together.
IC will combine the ‘Bill Print File’ and the ‘MAM File’ to create an 
Invoice File-New Bill
 (to import new invoices). Each day, IC will have a process that runs to determine which records exist in IC
Any records from the ‘MAM File’ that were combined with the ‘Bill Print File’ to create new invoices will be removed from the ‘MAM File’
Any records from the ‘MAM File’ that were not included in the Invoice File, will be used to compare against existing records in the IC system. If the records exist, IC will create an 
Invoice File-Update Existing Bills
 to update existing invoices via the IC Invoice Update process (invoice file with U records). One updated, these records will be removed from the ‘MAM File’.
Any remaining records from the ‘MAM File’ that have an indicator of being new will be used to create an 
Invoice File-New Account 
(to import new records, $0.00 balance invoices) - mapping below.
The remaining records in the ‘MAM File' will be put through the IC adjustment process to allow updates for the records in the Invoice File-New Account (using account number and balance).
More details can be found on each of these files on the 
National Fuel Gas (NFG) Technical Design
