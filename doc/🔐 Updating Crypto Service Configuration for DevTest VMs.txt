How to ensure your application connects correctly to the crypto service in the new DevTest virtual machines
 Instructions
✅ 
1. Check Your Connection Method
If you're using WCF service references:
Open your service reference configuration.
Update the endpoint URL to include /v1 at the end:
https://cryptoservice.invoicecloud.com/CryptoService.svc/v1
Point to a bindingConfiguration that does not include authentication.
Use the CTP project as a working reference:
Binding configuration example – lines 1–18
Endpoint setup example – lines 1–19
If using ic.serviceproxies
Check whether your app uses ic.serviceproxies to connect to the crypto service.
If so, the URL may be hardcoded in that package.
Determine which version of ic.serviceproxies you are referencing.
Look at the corresponding commit or source code to verify:
If the crypto service endpoint ends with /v1, you are good to go.
If not, update or override it accordingly.
Test Your Integration
Once the /v1 endpoint is configured:
Validate all crypto-related functionality (e.g., encryption, decryption, token handling).
The /v1 endpoint is stable and widely used, so any issues likely stem from configuration mismatches.
Clean Up Old Endpoints
Search your application configs for any deprecated crypto service endpoints.
If you find old endpoints that are no longer in use:
Remove them to prevent confusion and reduce maintenance risk.
