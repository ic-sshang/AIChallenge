User Management in the Biller Portal
Phase 1
Perform key user operations
For example: 
Change user login type
Transfer Account Ownership
Add payment method to a user 
Show user level information
Show the user that a saved payment method belongs to
Phase 2
Initiate registration
Link accounts and send a registration invite to the customer to register the group of linked accounts with an invite link
Cover unhappy payment method validation scenarios
Biller Portal Customer User Management
 
Only Data Services can promote/demote user login type
Can’t see payment methods that belong to non-Owner users
No ability to transfer account ownership and the Biller Portal user must unregister & re-register; no way to select a group of accounts to keep linked and transfer to another user
Reduce manual intervention required for common user tasks by empowering Billers
x% reduction in DBRs
Biller
 
Transfer Account Ownership
 in the Biller Portal (and Customer Portal)
When transferring account ownership:
Select or enter the new user to transfer the account over to
The user should have the ability to select which linked accounts are transferred
Remove saved payment methods
Remove AutoPay enrollments
Maintain transaction/payment history
Maintain Paperless settings
Transfer Ownership Operation
 
Users override email addresses and gain access to payment methods that do not belong to them
Cannot change the group that it is linked to without unregistering and re-registering
x% reduction in support cases
x% reduction in DBRs
Reduce risk of churn by Collier/BSU

Unique Logins
Unique Email Login / Auth Type
Prevent duplicate email logins
Phase 1: Stop the bleeding
CRM option: new “Unique” Email auth type, hide existing Email auth type
DB: enforce uniqueness at the DB level for legacy billers (cleanup/migration needed for existing dupes, but no more dupes should be created) 
User flow: require any user attempting to register with an existing email address to either (1) create a new login, or (2) reset password to regain access if their password is unknown
Phase 2: Migration and clean-up
Requires a dedicated application to link customers, decrypt and re-encrypt payment methods to consolidate logins. Crypto services collaboration needed for writing the clean-up utility. 
Payment methods and AutoPay should be preserved during login consolidation process.
Add Unique Login Email Constraint
 
System does not require unique email addresses for logins using the email auth type.
Support & Data Services need to manually investigate each case which can take 1-3 hours per.
Reduce time spent manually investigating email login issues
x% reduction in DBRs

Payer UX Improvements
Payer UX update
When editing AutoPay, if the payment method that an AutoPay is enrolled with does 
not 
belong to the user logged in we should hide the last 4 digits of the payment method.
Payer UX Updates
 
Last 4 digits of payment method are visible to all users on an account when viewing AutoPay not just the payment method owner
Reduce risk of churn by Collier/BSU
Fulfill longstanding request with Insurance billers
Payer - SPAM or WDIL
 
Transfer Account Ownership
 in the Customer Portal (and Biller Portal)
When transferring account ownership:
Transferring an account to a new user login
The user should have the ability to select which linked accounts are transferred
Payment methods are removed
AutoPay enrollments are removed
Paperless settings can remain
Transfer Ownership Operation
 
Users override email addresses and gain access to payment methods that do not belong to them
Cannot change the group that it is linked to without unregistering and re-registering
x% reduction in support cases
x% reduction in DBRs
Reduce risk of churn by Collier/BSU
Payer - TBD
Enable Biller Option 108 
by default
Audit Billers that do not have this option on to see if they should have it enabled
There is a use case that the BIF imports are the source of email updates that Billers prefer
Can we challenge or improve our handling of email updates when Biller Option 108 is not enabled?
Imports can improperly update email addresses when an email address already exists. This is especially problematic for Billers with email login auth type.

Integrations
S&S / SSO Registration Improvements
Account Owner role should end up registered using the email passed to IC by the SSO. The existing email on the Account Owner role should be copied into the Courtesy Email address field for the Account Owner role.
SPAM-188
2278e126-27dc-36c8-aef9-a32d91bc7ad7
System Jira
 
Prevents creating new Account Owner roles when a user is registering for the 1st time with SSO and a different email address
Improve relationship with S&S
Payer - SPAM
Fix inconsistencies with Unregistration
 behavior across the platform 
ICRemoteAuth API
Customer Portal
ICRestAPI
Unregistration Behaviors: Logins & Account Linking
 
Unregistration is handled differently depending on where it is occurring.
Customers remain enrolled in AutoPay or Recurring Scheduled Payments if they are unregistered or saved payment method is removed.
Consistent behavior
Payer
Account Linking Improvements
Improved Account Linking
Phase 1
Option to prevent automatic account linking
Could be specific to SAML or a Biller Option that covers all automatic linking scenarios
Phase 2
Smarter logic for automatic/manual account linking
Process to approve accounts linked that our system catches as needing admin oversight
Improper account linking is happening for Billers with SAML (ProAssurance)
x% reduction in Support Cases
TBD
Prevent improper account linking
2026 Q1/Q2
 Default, consistent behavior for account linking followed across the platform 
(this needs to be defined)
Accounts are automatically linked to users that should not have access to those accounts
x% reduction in Support Cases
TBD
Add logging in the Biller Portal for account linking/unlinking changes
Logging for account linking changes is not readily available for Biller users or Support
Time reduction on Support Cases
Biller
Registration Improvements
Payment Method Validation
During registration challenge a user to verify their payment method before registering them to that login with a payment method tied to it
Payment methods get tied to users during registration that might not belong to them
Security risk
Build trust
Payer - SPAM
Identify Landlord/Tenant
Identify Owner/Tenant 
User identification for property owners, landlord, tenant, etc. 
On our side, validate owner status (e.g., using Collier's existing property appraiser data and application information) to automate role assignment and reduce manual intervention
There is no way to identify if a user is an Owner, Landlord, or Tenant in our current system and is a burden for Billers
Improve user experience for GUB/Property Management scenarios
Payer
Pay by Text
Pay by Text
 enrollment by user
Pay by Text is at the Account Level and cannot be set by individual users
x% increase in PBT adoption

Problems Solved
Success Criteria
Teams
Centralized system for Multi-User Login
Code for logins and linking is spread across the app and all repos
Dedicated ownership of Logins and Account Linking 
TBD
Customizable User Login Types 
with configurable permissions 
Existing user types are rigid and not customizable
5 Billers configure customized user logins
Feature demoed to new Billers
TBD
Q4 Itemized Deliverables
Updates to the Customer Portal
Hide the last 4 digits of a payment method used for AutoPay when the logged-in user is linked to the account but is not the owner of that payment method.
When a user changes their email address in the Customer Portal, all saved payment methods and AutoPay enrollments will be cleared. This is a temporary measure while we develop the new 
Transfer Account Ownership 
feature, planned for release in 2026.
Updates to the Biller Portal
Managing Payment Methods
See which user a payment method belongs to
Add a new payment method and assign it to an individual user
Change a user’s role (for example: Co-owner to Account Oversight, or Guest to Account Owner, etc.)
Risk Log
High-level Approach
Risk
Mitigation Strategy
Next Steps
Prevent duplicate email logins
Payment methods & AutoPay must be preserved during login consolidation – if different users in fact handle different logins with the same email, they could gain access to payment methods that don’t belong to them.
Prevent duplicate email logins
If password resets need to occur, and it is a shared email address/inbox, race to reset could become problematic.
Prevent duplicate email logins
Billers are not aware of the impact of login consolidation
Clear communications with Billers that have a high volume of duplicate email logins or edge cases.
User Management in the Biller Portal
Billers are not confident in performing operations in the Biller Portal and still submit support cases.
As part of GTM strategy, collaborate closely with Training  & Client Services teams to ensure enablement materials are created, available, and circulated well amongst Billers.

Next Steps
Focus on high priority problems & Property Management scenarios. Then, satisfy Insurance needs & future proof Multi-User login. 
Define behaviors
 (e.g., 
unregistration/registration
, account linking/unlinking). 
  to dig into these. Mark confirmed various API entry points are not documented and should be.
Commit work for Q4:
Account transfer option
 from Customer Portal and Biller Portal
Stop supporting unique login emails (phase 1)
Imports
: Can we stop allowing email updates from BIF or add some admin oversight? Can Biller Option 108 be enabled as the default? What is the future of the Customer Import Tool? 
Plan & scope:
User Management
 feature in the Biller Portal. This will be a big source of reduced support costs and DBRs by empowering billers to do things that require data services. For example: allow Billers to change user login type; transfer account ownership and select the linked accounts to transfer.
Payment Method Validation
Centralized
 service for Logins, User Permissions, Registration/Unregistration, Account Linking
Path forward for inconsistent behaviors
 (goal to start chipping away at this in Q4)
