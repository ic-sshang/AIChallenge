TBD - Blocked
Pipeline work has already been completed and this may release earlier (build works, deploy doesn’t)
5/9/25 Update - fixing unit tests and testing deployment to devtest servers
6/9/25 Waiting on the deploy pipeline in the new Biller Project to be created so I can move over a copy of the current BillerPortal for testing.  
From Infra Engineer: These two new items should be groomed soon in our grooming session and slotted in upcoming sprints. Once we groom these i'll send over the tickets so you are aligned.
7/8/25 Update - Still waiting on deploy pipeline in the new Biller Project and no tickets have been sent over.
Goals and End Results
Remove the biller portal application from MyIIS and create a standalone application with it’s own business class library separate from IC.Common.  This will allow independent deployments for both apps and if something breaks in one, the other application can still be deployed.
Unit tests can now be separated, and in a similiar fashion to above, if a test breaks in one application the other can still be released.
The creation of it’s own MI and better visibility into how the application is performing.
The deployment of the stand alone biller portal application can begin earlier as business hours end at 8 EST for West coast billers.
The creation of a C# business class library to deprecate the VisualBasic version.  This will mimic the same namespaces as the VB library and should be a simple plug and play for each page in the BillerPortal application.
Possible Issues
If code is updated that impacts both applications, work must be duplicated until the implementation of a common source that can be consumed by both apps (Nuget)
While work is commencing on the separate application, developers must add all new BillerPortal code to the new BillerPortal.Business.VisualBasic library.  No references to IC.Common must be included.  Ideally, all new BillerPortal code should be added to the IC.Common.CSharp library which would then move over to the BillerPortal.Business C# library.  This will make testing and verify the code easier since it would already be proven in a production environment.
New Project and namespaces: 
MyIIS - Breakout Branch
BillerPortal.Business.VisualBasic
BillerPortal - BillerCustomer.aspx.vb
New Application and Project
BillerPortal application
Introduction of C# library
Using C# version of Database
Phase One
 
Phase One: Create a new library called BillerPortal.Business.VisualBasic
We will add a new BP specific library. This will give us separation between the Biller and Customer apps. At this point deployments can happen independently of each other as no shared logic will exist. All changes that target both areas must be done in both libraries (IC.Common and BillerPortal.Business.VisualBasic).  
If you are creating a new page in the BillerPortal.Business.VisualBasic library, please add a namespace or create a C# version in the IC.Common.CSharp library.  These C# files will move over to the BillerPortal.Business library in the new BillerPortal application.
Any changes that are specific to the BillerPortal only need those changes added into the BillerPortal.Business.VisualBasic.  You do not need to add them into the IC.Common library.  Vice versa for the Customer Portal.
Also at this time you should not add a reference back to IC.Common in the BillerPortal application.  Everything will now be separate and must remain separated.
Completed - Steps taken for Phase One:
(completed) 
Remove IC.Common library from current BillerPortal and create new  VB class library project 
(completed) 
Identify all pages used within the BillerPortal that reference the IC.Common library 
(completed) 
Copy code and rename classes (if necessary), add namespaces for easy transfer to C# library.  Folder structure modified, but keep code the same.  Examples:
Customer = clsCustomers
Invoice = clsInvoices
Biller = clsBillers
(completed) 
Update BillerPortal application to use new library.  Add references to all pages to point to new library
(completed - passed regression)
Build and deploy updated BillerPortal application with BillerPortal.Business.VisualBasic in devtest.  Verify everything is working as expected.  Promote to UAT, test and verify.  Promote to regression and run regression tests.  
(01/07/2025 - 01/21/2025)
 Test in regression including all of the following API and SOAP endpoints:
RTDR - 
(completed) - tested in regression
Certegy - 
(completed)  - tested in regression
Inovah - 
(completed)  - not used in biller application
MCC - 
(completed)  - unable to test in regression
Guts - 
(completed) - not used in biller application
CTP - 
(completed) 
BusinessService - 
(completed) 
CryptoService - 
(completed) 
DatabaseService - 
(completed) 
Cdyne - 
(completed) 
S and S - 
(completed) - not used in biller application
(01/07/2025 - 01/22/2025)
 
BMS tested in regression all pages in the biller portal and possible code paths
 
(completed) 
- Team PRISM will test all pages in the biller portal to verify new library functionality
 
(completed)
 - Team BMS will retest all pages in the biller portal to verify new library functionality
 
(completed) - 
branch moved to regression testing - 
3/21/2025
 (completed) 
- Deploy to production environment 04/3/2025

Phase Two
 
Phase Two - Separate out the BillerPortal application into its own repository:
While the new library is out in production, a new separate BP application hosted at 
https://dev.azure.com/invoicecloud/Biller/_git/BillerPortal
will be in the works setting up a new pipeline, MI, testing, etc. The plan is to complete this work in a few weeks after Phase 1 rolls out thereby reducing developer impact. Any new changes from the new library introduction will be merged with the new app once it is ready to be released.
Any C# version of code running in the IC.Common.CSharp library will be added to the C# BillerPortal.Business library. All work in the MyIIS BP will stop and any new work must target the new separate BP app. Any new functionality will be written in C# using the new C# BillerPortal.Business library.
Branching Strategy
The new BillerPortal applications default branch will now be main.  Please target main for any new PR’s into this new application.
Steps for Phase 2:
Create new template and pipeline in the Biller Project with enhancements and updates to original pipeline and template -
 in testing 5/9/25 - 
Move over latest version of BillerPortal code and libraries  - 
 (up to date 4/22/25)
Identify shared common tests in MyIIS and move them to the BillerPortal project.  Run and build unit tests around new repo -
 
in progress 5/9/25
Deploy code to devtest servers (including 2025 servers) and verify all pages and services are working as expected -
 
in progress 5/9/25
Deploy MyIIS and new BillerPortal application on the same devtest server.  Verify no conflicts or issues-
 not started
.
Promote BillerPortal application to regression and run the full suite of tests-
 not started
.  
Deploy to production-
 TBD
Phase Three
Phase Three - Remove BillerPortal and BillerPortal.Business.VisualBasic from MyIIS
The BillerPortal and BillerPortal.Business.VisualBasic library will be removed from MyIIS and the new Biller Portal will now run as a stand alone app.
BillerPortal specific code inside the IC.Common library will not be removed at this time. Unit, integration or functional tests inside the IC.Common unit test library will be removed at this time.
Phase Four
Phase Four - Integrate BillerPortal.Business C# library into Web application and depricate BillerPortal.Business.VisualBasic
The converted BillerPortal.Business C# library will be slowly integrated into the BillerPortal application. This can be done fairly easily as the new BillerPortal.Business.VisualBasic library has the same namespace structure as the C# library.
Targeting the new C# library can be done by simply replacing the .VisualBasic namespace tag in each page. Once all traces of the VB business library code have been removed, and the BillerPortal has fully switched over to the C# version, the VB library will be deleted from the repo.
Phase Five
Phase Five: Create a Nuget package to hold common functionality between Customer and BillerPortal applications
Identify code that both applications consume on each app. Create a nuget package with this common functionality that can be shared across both applications. This will prevent the need to write duplicate code.
Phase Six
Phase Six: Update Biller Portal to .Net 8 or future version equivalent
Run side by side versions of the Biller Portal with a feature toggle to migrate billers over to the new .net 8 version.
