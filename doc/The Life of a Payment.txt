Well before a payment is made the 
Braintree Boarding Process
 takes place and gets the biller setup to take payments.  This includes setting up the terminals that are used for the transmission of those payments, the allocation of the customer portal through which the payment is submitted, and the biller portal through which management and reporting are done.  A biller will have multiple invoice types associated with one or more terminals.  It is important to understand those configuration components to fully understand the payment workflow.
When a customer accesses the customer portal, they are generally provided with the information about the bills for which they are responsible.  Then they may have a choice to pay by ACH, Credit Card, Venmo, etc.  They may also have the opportunity to set up recurring payments.  Inevitably, once all of the necessary selections are made, they will click a button.  This will either, submit the payment, or it will schedule the payment to kick off when it’s picked up for a future batch run.  Either approach will eventually trigger a payment being made in the system.  This is where the true life of the payment begins.
