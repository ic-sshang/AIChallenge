Are there any major roadblocks to delivering this functionality?
Is there an option to monetize this feature?  Pricing strategy?
What metrics can/will we use to measure success?
Biller interview prompts. Note these are meant to spur discussion, and additional probing questions will be asked as we learn more.

Interview Notes
Mishawaka
Mishawaka, WI
What is Chatbot?
Done right, it’s great.  Done wrong, pain/annoyance.
Wrong is: won’t go away, too pushy, forces the issue
Shouldn’t be for sales, should for support
Have you considered chatbots before / do you currently have one?  Provide details.
Had conversations with Cisco about Webex platform, but nothing there yet
Have you heard your customers asking for online support channels?
Unsure, maybe we could launch a survey
Expect they would have quick adoption on it, and a quick shift away from traditional methods
What tasks would your customers want to perform via a chatbot?
Am I in the right place?
Help me pay my bill
Sign up for paperless/etc
Are customers able to self-serve on these tasks today?  If so, how?
Depends on the issue, some yes
Are you able to provide data on which tasks customer support tasks are currently performed by your staff?
Yes, he will provide a list after the call
Can you provide a disposition summary on these tasks?
Not discussed
Which language support is mandatory?
English, Spanish

Do you have the access/ability to embed JavaScript within your website?
Yes, no concerns
Are there any policies within your organization that would restrict the use of Artificial Intelligence?
None that he’s aware of

Any inquiry that takes that workload off a human
95% of successful inquiries
Fix the bill pmt vs cloud pmt issue (this needs research)
Which, if any, pricing model would be acceptable? (per-task-completion, monthly fee, one-time, etc)
Unfamiliar with AI bot assistants
Tiers of functionality
Base tier – included by default
Premium tier
inquiries that are more general, non-IC; Can it extract the info from the biller website?
Integration with human support
One-time setup cost makes sense too
Other notes
Needs to be more than just pointing to help articles, needs to be more dynamic and fluid, particularly for the older folks
Build with elderly in mind?  Are they the most likely users?
Would you be willing to participate in a chatbot beta program?
Yes
Mobile
Mobile, AL
What comes to mind when we use the word chatbot?
Pre-determine automated response to questions (x2)
Have you heard your customers asking for online support channels?
No, nothing
What tasks would your customers want to perform via a chatbot?
Quick responses
Bill balance lookup, due date lookup
Ways to pay
Office hours
Support
Leak credit
High bill
Complex inquiries
“Why isn’t a payment reflected on my account?”
“How much do I need to pay to keep my water on?”
They can prevent shutoffs
Most of them are payment related
Provide info?
No, not really
Are customers able to self-serve on these tasks today?  If so, how?
Yes, on current chatbot
Are you able to provide data on which customer support tasks are currently performed by your staff?
Can you provide a disposition summary on these tasks?

Are there any policies within your organization that would restrict the use of Artificial Intelligence?
What would you need to see to declare the chatbot a success?
Which, if any, pricing model would be acceptable? (per-task-completion, monthly fee, one-time, etc)
Have you considered chatbots before / do you currently have one?  Provide details.
Currently have chat, it’s a live person
They have a live chat today; KIOSK and IC e-mails and texts; just don’t have a chat BOT - through NICE phone system; see what the product is - will be helpful to share as a follow up
No automation currently
Would you be willing to participate in a chatbot beta program?
Other notes
Need to be able to authenticate on other things besides account number (address? last name?)
Would need to operate 24x7, escalations only during business hours
Nice thing is it’s connected to IC and can pull customer information
Customers are currently being blocked?  IC keeps blocking people from making ETF payments, other than that, most of it is okay - it’s being “autoblocked” today; there is no visibility into communications on what was sent so their live support can address blocks and why
CDELightband
CDE Lightband
What comes to mind when we use the word chatbot?
Any self-service options are always helpful
Have you heard your customers asking for online support channels?
They already have
What tasks would your customers want to perform via a chatbot?
At the beginning, it was general inquires
As the customers became educated, the questions became less frequent and most sophisticated
Most common is wanting to connect service (still haven’t moved there, transient military town)
Pmt related questions happen, and payment arrangements
Pmt arrangements - live agent now, but they want to automated their standard procedure
Are customers able to self-serve on these tasks today?  If so, how?
Yes, chatbot for basic tasks, live agent for sophisticated
Are you able to provide data on which customer support tasks are currently performed by your staff?
Yes, she will send over after call
Can you provide a disposition summary on these tasks?
Which language support is mandatory?

Spanish is a must

Will prompt them to use keywords, give canned responses
Type HELP if they want a live agent
Will be treated just like a phone call
Do you have the access/ability to embed JavaScript within your website?
Yes, they have their own BI analyst and 3rd party company to put on website

Just had a mtg with MyTel vendor
They try to be cutting edge, very interested in AI
What would you need to see to declare the chatbot a success?
Their current chatbot is successful but not optimized
More and more people want this
Viewed as a customer experience tool, not a cost savings tool ← important that we factor this in to success metrics
Which, if any, pricing model would be acceptable? (per-task-completion, monthly fee, one-time, etc)
Current rolled into contact center platform
Monthly access fee is most reasonable due to high volume use
Have you considered chatbots before / do you currently have one?  Provide details.
They DO have a chatbot, FAQ, general info, pass to live agent (elec and broadband)
Through contact center platform (name? MyTel?)
Also two-way SMS, in 2020 (pandemic) - is this an oppotunity?
Their chatbot is very process-driven, will only respond to keywords within the customer-entered text
Would you be willing to participate in a chatbot beta program?
Yes, that’s great
Any other thoughts/notes?
Any learning curve on previous rollout? Not internally, but they needed to put some money into marketing/awareness it so people knew they could chat online and text/sms
SanJose
San Jose Water
What comes to mind when we use the word chatbot?

“We’re here to serve our customers, not get rid of them, we like the personal touch”
What does “our site” mean to you?  customer site
Implementing AMI in the Fall, and updating CIS, so they have a lot of tech upgrades going on right now

Are you able to provide data on which customer support tasks are currently performed by your staff?

Diversity is important
What’s your expectation for how the chatbot would hand off to a human if it cannot help the customer?
A callback to their system, to create a case?  Send an email?

No
Would you be willing to participate in a chatbot beta program?
Super interested in learning more, but unsure if we can commit
Any other thoughts/notes?
