Include survey
Angela
Survey at the end of the chat is out of scope
If it is NPS style, there could be value to gather feedback 
Follow up on data piece after Karthic completes his review of the technical stack. Once we have clarity on the direction we’re going, we can talk through the elements that we need to track? Karthic help validate what’s possible given the way we’re going to implement this.
Question mark around the survey piece? if it takes an exhorbitant amount and delays P1, we may need to pull it. Simple NPS style question in MVP could add value.
7:30min
Internal tracking
 
Work backwards. What internally will we need to do know for the success / failure of this tool?  So if the survey review comes into that “can’t ship without this tracking. Everything we haven’t previously discussed should be challenged to “Does this hold up launch? Can this be a V1.1?” 
 
Matt likes the internal tracking. But we need to be judicious at this time.
IC will not be involved in internal tracking. Pendo will NOT work. We have payment data, but the vast majority of the interactions won’t touch InvoiceCloud. 
 
12:00
Authentication flow
 
Advanced search doesn’t have a field to pass the name. We need to pass the search type fields that are required. It would be Primary and optional Secondary.
16:00min
Advanced search
 
Advanced search / API lookup to find account is the right approach for authentication
Any new APIs we should consider in scope for this?
If we determine that it’s not sufficient for what we need we will just axe it.
If the search is unsuccessful, then we have to prompt and retry (rule of 3). If we can’t find the account after 3 times, we can go to the escalation flow.
20:30min
See my invoice
 
If they want to see the invoice, do we escalate right away because it’s not in the MVP? Do we authenticate them and escalate? Or do we escalate right away?
Visual representation of invoice?
Falls out of scope and goes through the escalation.
22:12
Need a subsequent API on IC side to get total balance?
 
After the advanced search authentication is successful, we’re only going to show the amount due. Do we need to hit a subsequent API to get the total amount due (which include previous amounts returned in the initial advanced search response)?
Do we need to hit a subsequent API to get all of the balance information and roll it up on a total amount to present to that?
Right now, IC displays the balance of the oldest, open invoice. 
Once you go through the payment flow, it will do the same API call after the payment is processed and finds the next oldest, open balance. Goes through the loop until the balance is zero. Lowest effort solution for paying something. 
The question here is, do we want that same type of experience? DO we want a hybrid where we may NOT allow shopping cart, but we will at least allow you to pay the full balance, or we can do the shopping cart. Definitely change to the API. Will return a dataset/array that will list the options you have. That’s the cadillac.
Today, if people pay more, it doesn’t automatically to other open invoices. It only applies to the invoice type ID/ Invoice GUID that is associated with the amount due. There could be multiple InvoiceGUIDs asscociated with that account, but we cannot see it until we hit the advanced search again.
Even if we wanted to provide a scenario on overpaying on one invoice. There are billers that have rules in place where Billers don’t allow overpayments. So the payment won’t even approve because it’s over the amount billers allow.
Get through the exercise and itemize out on where we may be dependent on IC resources and decide if we want to go down that route. If we do, it will phenomenally increase level of effort. 
 
If we decide to show an invoice, there are no other APIs needed from IC otherwise. 
 
Not worth it to add shopping cart because it will require IC resources.

New API for Total Balance [Summation of all open invoices]
Three options:
Keep the same experience of displaying oldest, open invoice and go through the payment loop until zero balance (worst experience / easiest effort)
Hybrid experience where we provide a way to pay total amount (most effort and new API)
Provide shopping cart (out of scope for MVP)

2nd option for the existing API we have to submit payment (whether IVR or chatbot) for an amount that doesn’t match the invoice it’s submitted on, the system doesn’t know what to do.

After successful payment for V1 solution, the bot can say there are still a balance due on the account.
