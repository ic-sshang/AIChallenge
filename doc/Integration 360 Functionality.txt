Introduction
Integration 360 (AKA Int360) is a tool used for onboarding a new biller which uses 
Standard Software Integration Partner
 (Alliance partner) like BS&A, WaterSmart, Harris Advanced Utility Systems etc. As part of implementation, the InvoiceCloud implementation manager has to work with the billers to get the details for setting up the integration in CRM. 
CRM settings set by Int360
Biller Advanced Configuration Settings
FTP Configuration Settings
Data Pump Settings
Invoicing Settings
As these are 
standard software integrations
 most of the time it is the same set of configurations (or similar) which is applied for the new biller. 
note
The primary purpose of Int360 tool is to populate the similar/repetitive standard software integration configuration value in InvoiceCloud CRM.

As part of the current workflow the IMs have to gather details in order to setup all the required integrations for a new biller in InvoiceCloud CRM, and in case of Standard Integration most of the information will be same/similar in nature. In order to reduce the manual effort of IMs i.e., key in all the values in CRM, Int360 tool can be used to populate the templatised values (as reference) so that IMs can work with biller and replace the placeholder values with biller specific values.
On successful completion of above flow the values are populated in CRM and audit line is show under 
Notes 
section for the biller
InvoiceCloud CRM
Advantages of using Int360
Reduced manual effort i.e., setting up values in CRM, as IM can refer the templatised values which are pre-populated.
Reduced chances of missing the integration specific values while setting up biller in CRM.
Reduced to No involvement of Intergration Engineering team is setting up a new biller if it is using Standard Integration partner.  
Useful Information

Future Enhancements
Enhancing the end user i.e., Implantation manager user experience by automating manual effort of apply Int360 settings for a biller. 
As currently IM has to take multiple steps to apply these settings, in future it will be added as part of Biller Wizard (via InvoiceCloud CRM) flow. 
Int360 will be added as a last stage of Biller Wizard workflow. 
Improving the processes of Software Integration Partner profile creation (with templatized values)
As mentioned in 
Current Flow section
 currently there are two teams involved in setting up a software partner profile i.e., Integration Engineering Team(to come with instructions) and Data Services Team(to execute the instructions in form if SQL Scripts), building a UI will enable the faster biller onboarding and less to no involvement of multiple teams.
