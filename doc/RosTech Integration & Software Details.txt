PDF Extraction - Supported
Template - Not Supported
Web Services or sFTP
The integration supports PDF Linking and PDF Extraction. Template is not supported. It is expected that each UMBS client will choose their own print vendor, so Bill Presentment will be handled on a client-by-client basis.  PDF linking via a document retrieval API is Invoice Cloud’s preferred method of presenting bills from the UX.
