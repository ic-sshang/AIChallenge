There are a few different types of a health checks such as: liveliness and readiness probes, to deeper ones such as canary requests to test the correctness of a business function in production. 
The aim of a health check is to provide insight into the current “health” of your system. 
Such as: 
Is the service running. Is the service able to communicate with its dependencies such as the database? If a queue is involved in asynchronous work, is the count staying close to 0? or is work stacking up? 
Health checks should have as little impact on the system as possible. The lower the impact a check has, the more often it can be run without adding noticeable load. The more often it can run, the more likely it will find issues before your customers.
Basic Health Checks:
All applications should at least have liveliness and readiness probes. For more information about them, see this document: 
Liveness and Readiness Probes
 
TLDR: 
Liveliness and readiness probes are run frequently to determine if an application is running, and capable of accepting a request. These are often used by load balancers or infrastructure orchestrators such as Kubernetes to determine where requests should be routed, or if a service needs to be restarted.
