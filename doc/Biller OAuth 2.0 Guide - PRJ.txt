Overview
This guide provides instructions for integrating with Biller APIs that support OAuth 2.0 authentication using the Client Credentials Grant. The token endpoint for obtaining the access token is:
https://api.invoicecloud.co/biller/v1/authentication/oauth2/token
Prerequisites
Client ID
 and 
Client Secret
: Obtain these credentials from Invoice Cloud.
Token Endpoint URL
: 
https://api.invoicecloud.com/biller/v1/authentication/oauth2/token
Step-by-Step Integration
Obtain Access Token
To authenticate using the Client Credentials Grant, you need to obtain an access token by making a POST request to the token endpoint.
Request:
text
POST /biller/v1/authentication/oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
Host: api.invoicecloud.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
Parameters:
grant_type
: Must be set to 
client_credentials
.
client_id
: Your application's client ID.
client_secret
: Your application's client secret.
Handle the Response
The response will include the access token, which you will use to authenticate subsequent API requests.
Example Response:
json
{
  "access_token": "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600
}
Response Fields:
access_token
: The token you will use for authentication.
token_type
: The type of token, typically 
Bearer
.
expires_in
: The duration in seconds for which the token is valid.
Error Handling
If the token request fails, the response will include an error message. Common errors include invalid client credentials or incorrect grant type.
Example Error Response (400 Bad Request):
json
{
  "error_description":"Invalid client authentication",
  "error":"invalid_client"
}
Use the Access Token
Include the access token in the 
Authorization
 header of your API requests.
Example API Request:
text
GET /biller/v1/resource HTTP/1.1
Host: api.invoicecloud.com
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
Conclusion
By following these steps, you can successfully integrate with Biller APIs that support OAuth 2.0 authentication using the Client Credentials Grant. Ensure that you securely store your client credentials and handle access tokens appropriately.
