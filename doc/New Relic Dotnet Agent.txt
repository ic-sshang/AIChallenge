New Relic Dotnet Agent Excerpt
Pre+Post-Provisioning
We use the New Relic Dotnet Agent to send APM data from our applications to New Relic.

Note: 
may require injection of license key during post-provisioning. Don’t include sensitive values in the image.
While we can install the agent during the image build, we should not include any secrets at that point. We’ll need to inject secrets at runtime.
