User Experience
Unique Processes
NFG has processes to send letters to payers when certain activities occur (ex: new invoice available/First Email Notification.) When a first email notification bounces to an email address, NFG will send a letter in the mail about their new invoice. 
NFG does not have access to Box. For any/all documents shared with NFG, they must be emailed or stored elsewhere.
Service Level Agreement
Exhibit C - pages 24-26 of NFG signed documents:
IC agreed to several SLA’s outlined in this document. High level summary:

Output files (payment and reversal files will be placed on SFTP no more than 2 hours after the agreed upon time - 4:30pm EST)

Data Conversion Details
File Specification: This is the file specification that NFG’s previous provider will send for the data conversions
NOTE: IC will be importing data as of 8/6 from ACI. When a new file (in the above specified format) is provided on 8/23, IC will run a process to compare the two files and import the differences/changes. Example: Account 123 is enrolled in paperless on 8/6 and unenrolls o n8/10. IC will remove the paperless enrollment after the change is identified in the ‘delta’ between the two files.

Allow Credit/Debit Card as Default Payment Method
Payers have the option to pay via Credit/Debit Card or ACH, if the Biller supports both. If this Option is allowed Credit/Debit Card will be set as the default payment method. If not allowed then ACH will be the default payment method. Payers may still switch between both as usual.
Disabled
NFG wants ACH to be the default payment method

Do not automatically start Paperless enrollment when completing AutoPay
By default the Invoice Cloud platform will start the Paperless enrollment process for the Customer if they sign up for AutoPay. In this scenario, Paperless will always require an email confirmation in order to complete enrollment. If this is checked, we will not trigger the Paperless enrollment when completing AutoPay.
Enabled
Biller does not want Paperless enrollment started when AutoPay enrollment occurs.
