Post inline donation payments to InHance
Billers who implement inline donations want IC to post payments in real-time
Item cancelled due to IC unable to post inline and adhoc payments according to the specifications. If/when InHance is ready to engage to make updates, a new item will be opened.

IC does not have 'PayPal' as payment type in Data Pump class - clsInhance
Added support for the PayPal payment type in DataPump for InHance billers.
Not all billers were ready to accept paypal codes via Data Pump. This change should return “Credit Card” by default and if the Advanced Setting 116 is set, return that value instead.

No email address sends through RTDR
IC update email when request for balance update through RTDR 
Add email in RTDR balance update. Use JSON configuration for the change on biller level. If no configuration set up, do not update email address on IC side.

TBD
TotalAmountDue is not updated with RTDR call in current version.
Create an advance setting to indicate that version 2 will be used.  In version 2, decimal Balance is used to update BalanceDue and decimal FutureBalance is used to update TotalAmountDur.  The same logic regarding updating email addresses will exist in both versions.
Several billers using this integration need the ability to update TotalAmountDue which is obtained from the RTDR API decimal FutureBalance field.
