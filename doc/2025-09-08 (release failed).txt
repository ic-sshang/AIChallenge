Production Server Update – Monday, 08-09-2025
We have provisioned the new 2025 production Windows servers and deployed all required applications. On 
Monday, 08-09-2025 at 10:00 AM IST
, we will add one of these new servers to the backend pool alongside the existing servers. This will allow production traffic to be served by the new server, enabling us to monitor application performance and stability in a live environment.
Monitoring Plan:
Monitoring responsibilities will be shared among respective product owners as outlined below.
Checkpoints will be conducted 
hourly
, with collaboration happening via a dedicated 
Slack channel
.
A 
Go/No-Go decision
 will be made at 
3:30 PM IST
 to determine whether the new server remains in the pool or is removed.

The above release failed, so had to take the below actions items
Added missing path for stratus C:\Data\AppData\Files\StratusDump
Added Apple pay certs [imported from bitwarden] in cert manager
Added 
invoicecloud.com
 hostfile entry as we received 502’s [just to be sure added entries for greensboro, sso, stratus, ncf,nsp as well]
Had to set the BITS serve to Manual start (too many restarts were observed during this windows)
CloudEMV had issues with keyvault, newrelic entity - this is resolved now
The above action items are taken care of, adding the server back to pool in this release windows.
