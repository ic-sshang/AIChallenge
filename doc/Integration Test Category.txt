Categories ensure that certain tests, such as integration tests or long-running tests, are not executed during the build pipeline, thereby optimizing build times and resource usage.
Use a standard well-known test category name to avoid confusion and errors.
NUnit Test Fixture Example
The attribute 
Category
 is used to group tests either individual or fixtures.  “IntegrationTests” is used to denote a fixture of integration tests.  The test runner can run specific categories or exclude categories.
c#
[TestFixture]
[Category("IntegrationTests")]
public class ShoppingCartRepositoryTests
{

}
Build Pipeline Example
The 
testFilter
 parameter, line 25, is used to exclude tests with the attribute category “IntegrationTests” via the 
!=
 operator.
