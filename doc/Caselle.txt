Summary
There are 3 different types of Integrations between IC and Caselle:
Batch: There are two batch integrations, one for Clarity (legacy) and one for Connect:
Clarity: Legacy Caselle software - batch integration only
Connect: Updated version of Caselle Software. Connect software can be implemented in Batch or Real-Time. The goal is to put billers on Real-Time instead of Batch. Civic is a Caselle software reseller and has an implementation fee of $1500 to implement the real-time integration. IC is generally willing to pay this fee to put the biller on the real-time integration. Talk to Martha Greer for more information.
Real-Time Utility: One real-time integration option with Connect software
Real-Time Accounts Receivable: One real-time integration option for non-utility types of payments. (Example: airport hanger, industrial building, land lease)
All Caselle integrations can be coded with a payment/lockbox file to be sent for Cloud Stores.
