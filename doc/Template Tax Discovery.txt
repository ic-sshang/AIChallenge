Response/Decision
Date
What is the best way for IC to update balances? An API is preferred to allow IC to connect to your system to obtain the most recent balance.  
Invoice Cloud prefers using an API to connect to the external system to obtain real time balances.  This is referred to as RTDR (real time data refresh)?

Does the API allow balance to be pulled by invoice or by full account balance?
How will installments be presented within the API balance response?
API:

Integrator file (if not using IC BAF)
         Can you customize what is generated in the file?
Requirement:  If a bill is paid outside of Invoice Cloud and the balance is now zero, the adjustment file must include this information.
If open billing, does the adjustment file contain the necessary information to match invoices on Invoice Cloud?
Will the file contain the adjusted balance or only the adjustments amount for each invoice?
