Complete SOC Audit
Products: IC, IVRTG, PSN
Value Proposition
760
Continuous protection of sensitive data:
 SOC 2 enforces strong controls around access, monitoring, and incident response, lowering the likelihood of breaches.
Standardized controls across the org:
 Reduces ad-hoc security practices by aligning teams on a tested, audited control framework.
Risk visibility:
 Ongoing audits and evidence collection highlight gaps early, so issues can be fixed before they become breaches or incidents.
Proof of reliability:
 A SOC 2 report is an independently verified signal to customers, partners, and prospects that your organization takes security and data protection seriously.
Competitive differentiator:
 In SaaS, fintech, and enterprise sales, SOC 2 is often the baseline requirement for doing business. Being compliant expands the customer pool and shortens security reviews.
Pass the 2026 SOC2 Audits
Remove NetworkService Identity from Web Apps
Products: IC
Value Proposition
760
Smaller blast radius:
 NetworkService uses the 
computer account
 on the network; if one site is compromised, an attacker may leverage the machine’s AD identity to access other resources. A per-app identity limits lateral movement.
Tighter ACLs:
 With AppPoolIdentity you get a unique SID 
IIS AppPool\<AppPoolName>
. You can grant file/registry/cert permissions 
only
 to that app, not to every site on the box.
Better outbound control:
 Per-app identities let you target firewall, proxy, and secret permissions precisely. NetworkService makes all apps “look the same” off-box.
Principle of least privilege by default:
 ApplicationPoolIdentity has fewer local privileges than NetworkService (which can sometimes pick up powerful rights via the machine account in domain contexts).
Key Results
100% of IIS applications migrated to unique identities (AppPoolIdentity or gMSA)
Zero outages during cutover (apps maintain full functionality post-migration)
All production apps mapped to distinct service principals with documented access permissions
Clear documentation for onboarding new apps with per-pool identities
Separate Payment Apps from Non-Payment Apps
Products: IC
Value Proposition
760
Clear PCI DSS scope boundary:
 By separating payment systems, only the servers hosting PCI apps fall into PCI audit scope. This reduces the number of systems and controls that must be validated annually.
Reduced attack surface:
 Non-PCI apps (often with more frequent code changes, third-party libraries, or broader integrations) won’t provide a stepping stone into highly sensitive payment environments.
Stronger segmentation:
 Dedicated infrastructure allows for firewalling, network segmentation, and monitoring tuned specifically to payment apps, making lateral movement far harder for attackers.
Least privilege enforcement:
 PCI servers can run with hardened OS baselines, stricter patching schedules, and limited accounts — without burdening non-PCI workloads with unnecessary overhead.
Isolation of vulnerabilities:
 A security flaw in a non-PCI app (e.g., CMS, marketing portal) cannot be exploited to gain a foothold in the PCI environment.
Minimized blast radius:
 Outages, resource contention, or misconfigurations in non-PCI apps won’t impact critical payment systems.
Targeted monitoring & alerting:
 Payment apps often require more rigorous logging, intrusion detection, and SIEM rules — separation prevents false positives from unrelated workloads.
Key Results
100% of PCI/Payment applications migrated
 to dedicated, hardened servers with no non-PCI workloads remaining.
Zero shared service accounts or file shares
 between PCI and non-PCI applications.
Clear documentation for onboarding new apps.
Migrate IVRTG to Azure (if funded)
Products: IVRTG
Value Proposition
760

All system configurations provisioned using Ansible
Eliminate 
single-point-of-failure infrastructure
Migration to MariaDB 12 (if staying on-premise)
Products: IVRTG
Value Proposition
760
Query optimizations:
 MariaDB 12 introduces enhancements in the query optimizer, execution plans, and cost-based optimization, resulting in faster queries, especially on complex joins and analytics queries.
Faster replication:
 Enhanced parallel replication improves replication lag and reliability in high-throughput environments.
Improved storage engines:
 Enhancements in InnoDB, Aria, and ColumnStore improve flexibility for both transactional and analytical workloads.
Long-term support (LTS):
 MariaDB 12 is under active support, whereas older 10.x releases are nearing or past end-of-life, meaning fewer security patches and bug fixes if you stay behind.
Compliance alignment:
 Staying on supported versions ensures access to ongoing security patches and audit requirements (important for PCI, SOC 2, HIPAA, etc.).
Key Results

Migrate 2016 Hypervisors to 202x (if staying on-premise)
Products: PSN
Value Proposition
760
Stronger baseline security:
 Hyper-V 2025 builds on Windows Server’s 
secured-core
 features (e.g., virtualization-based security, Credential Guard, TPM attestation) to harden workloads.
Up-to-date patching & support:
 Hyper-V 2016 mainstream support ended in Jan 2022; extended support ends Jan 2027. Upgrading now ensures a long runway of vendor patches and reduces compliance risks.
Encrypted VM capabilities:
 Expanded support for shielded VMs and storage encryption protect workloads in regulated environments (PCI, HIPAA, SOC 2, etc.).
Isolation improvements:
 Enhanced container/VM boundary protections lower the risk of privilege escalation or lateral movement attacks.
Higher density:
 Optimized scheduling and NUMA balancing allow running more VMs per host with less overhead.
Better storage & networking throughput:
 Updates to SMB Direct, RDMA, and Storage Spaces Direct provide higher IOPS, lower latency, and faster VM migrations.
Faster live migration:
 Improved live migration performance reduces downtime during maintenance or balancing.
Key Results
100% of production Hyper-V hosts upgraded to 
Windows Server 2025 Hyper-V
Zero critical/high vulnerabilities
 reported in post-upgrade security scans.
All shielded VM and encryption features enabled
 for in-scope regulated workloads.
Hypervisor Replacements (if staying on-premise)
Products: IVRTG, PSN
Value Proposition
760
Reduced exposure to hardware failures:
 Out-of-warranty servers have higher risk of disk, CPU, or memory failure, which can cascade into VM outages.
Eliminates unsupported firmware/driver stacks:
 Vendors stop issuing patches for old hardware, leaving potential vulnerabilities unmitigated.
Strengthened compliance posture:
 Auditors often flag unsupported infrastructure as a risk; refreshing hardware helps maintain SOC 2, PCI DSS, HIPAA, and ISO 27001 compliance.
Modern CPU/memory architecture:
 New servers support more vCPUs, higher RAM density, and better NUMA balancing — enabling higher VM density.
Key Results
100% of out-of-warranty hypervisors decommissioned
 and workloads migrated to new, supported servers.
Zero unplanned outages
 caused by hardware failure during or after the refresh project.
All servers under vendor warranty/support contracts
.

Production Migration to Clustered Percona for MongoDB  (if staying on-premise)
Products: IVRTG
Value Propositions
760
Enterprise-grade features without license fees:
 Percona Server for MongoDB (PSMDB) includes auditing, LDAP/Kerberos authentication, role-based access, and encryption features that MongoDB Community Edition lacks.
Enhanced auditing:
 PSMDB adds audit logging, useful for SOC 2, PCI DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR compliance.
TLS improvements:
 Enforces stronger defaults for encrypted traffic between nodes and clients.
Replica set high availability:
 Eliminates the single point of failure — if one node goes down, others automatically take over, ensuring continuous service.
Read scalability:
 Applications can offload reads to secondaries, improving performance under load.
Advanced monitoring:
 Native integration with 
Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM)
 gives deep insights into queries, replication lag, slow ops, and resource utilization.

100% of production MongoDB workloads running on Percona Server replica sets
 (no single instances remaining).
All client and inter-node connections encrypted
 with TLS.
Monitoring integrated with PMM (Percona Monitoring & Management)
 for all clusters with replication, query, and system dashboards.
HashiCorp Vault Production Deployment (if staying on-premise)
Products: IVRTG
Value Proposition
760
No hard-coded secrets:
 Eliminates risk of developers accidentally committing credentials to source control, CI/CD logs, or containers.
Short-lived credentials:
 Vault issues dynamic secrets (for databases, cloud APIs, SSH, etc.) with automatic TTLs and lease revocation, reducing exposure if compromised.
Centralized rotation:
 Credentials are automatically rotated or revoked by Vault, eliminating manual key rotation (often overlooked).
Reduced blast radius:
 Each app gets unique, time-bound credentials instead of reusing shared, long-lived static credentials.
Auditability:
 Every credential issuance, renewal, and revocation is logged centrally, enabling forensics and compliance reporting.
No redeploys for secret changes:
 Since apps request credentials at runtime, developers don’t need to push code/config updates when passwords rotate.
Reduced outages from expired creds:
 Automatic renewal or re-issuance lowers risk of downtime due to forgotten static credential expirations.
Meets regulatory requirements:
 PCI DSS, SOC 2, HIPAA, ISO 27001 all require secure credential management and auditability — Vault provides both.
Key Results
100% of static credentials removed from source code, repos, and config files
.
All production apps using Vault-issued dynamic credentials
 for databases, APIs, and cloud services.
Zero secrets leaked
 to version control.
Credential lifetime reduced from 
months → hours/minutes
Finish HA Clusters of Web Services (if staying on-premise)
Products: IVRTG
Value Propositions
760
Eliminates single point of failure:
 A single server outage or crash no longer brings down the entire app — HAProxy automatically routes traffic to healthy instances.
Graceful failover:
 When an instance is unavailable (maintenance, deployment, crash), HAProxy removes it from the pool, ensuring uninterrupted service.
Higher uptime SLAs:
 Supports business continuity by reducing downtime risk from hardware, software, or OS failures.
Improved request throughput:
 HAProxy spreads load across multiple backends, avoiding bottlenecks.
Performance under load:
 Applications remain responsive even under spikes in user traffic.
Rolling deployments:
 New versions of the app can be deployed server by server without downtime — HAProxy routes traffic only to healthy instances.
Key Results
100% of production traffic routed through HAProxy
 across at least 2 Django instances.
Failover tested successfully
 (HAProxy reroutes traffic within ≤5 seconds when an instance goes down).
Blue/green or canary deployment tested successfully.

Value Propositions
Key Results
Evaluate usage of ArgoCD for K8s
Possibly something like Rancher would be more useful for our K8s tooling and understanding K8s ecosystem as it allows for single pane of glass into all K8s Clusters.  
 opinion is that a Continuous Deployment tool for K8s would not follow our current Release Process and not sure of the value other than automatic deployment to the DEV Environment.
