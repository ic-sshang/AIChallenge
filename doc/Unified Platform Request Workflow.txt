Statuses
Status
Purpose
Submitted
User completed questionnaire and created request. We haven’t looked at it yet.
Review
We’re looking at the request. We ask the customer for any missing details.
This is when we set the request type to either change, access, or debug.
For changes, we come up with implementation and backout plans. For access, we ensure the scope of access is clearly defined.
We should also set priority during review.
Any debug requests submitted should be considered high priority unless manually determined otherwise (just set manually).
Authorize
This is where we get the boss’s thumbs up! Well, the boss meaning the INFRA approvers group (Jesse, Jai, Michael, Scott).
May ask for manager’s approval (manually - no need to add to workflow) for things like elevated access requests. 
Debug requests get to skip this.
Pending
We’ve gathered all the details, come up with our plan, and are ready to take action! The item stays in this status until we’ve got some free time to actually begin work on it.
In Progress
We’re doing the work!
Deployment Queue
We’ve done all the work we can without being in a change window.
To get here, fix version must be set.
Waiting on Customer
We need more details or clarification.
Done
We’ve either canceled or completed the request.
Blocked
We still want to work on the request, but some dependency needs to be done first.
To get here, the request must have an item linked as 
blocked by
.
Questionnaire
This will be completed during submission. Answers will not be used to set any fields or determine any workflows apart from the summary (hopefully we will do this in the future, though).
This is a first cut intended to help us change our current workflow quickly without spending too much time debating or locking ourselves into any particular pattern.

Manager Approvals
