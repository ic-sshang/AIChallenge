Objective:
To analyze and document the integration approach between InvoiceCloud’s Biller Portal (BP/CRM systems) and SecureAuth, with a focus on the techniques used for managing and creating user accounts. This includes identifying API endpoints, authentication mechanisms, data mapping strategies, and user lifecycle workflows to ensure secure, scalable, and efficient user provisioning across systems.
In 
SecureAuth
, user creation and management can be handled through 
two different scopes
: 
Pools
 and 
Workspaces
. Each approach has distinct use cases and implications. Here's a breakdown of both:
1. Creating Users via Pools
A 
Pool
 in SecureAuth represents a logical grouping of users — similar to a tenant or an isolated identity store. Pools are typically used to segment user populations (e.g., customers, employees, partners).
How User Creation Works:
Users are created 
under a specific pool
 using the SecureAuth 
system-level API
.
API Endpoint (example):
POST /api/identity/default/system/pools/{pool_id}/users
POST /api/identity/default/admin/pools/{ipID}/users
2. Creating Users via Workspaces
A 
Workspace
 is a more 
flexible container for identity management
 that can span across pools and provides 
collaborative tools
 for managing users, roles, and other resources.
 How User Creation Works:
Users can be created 
within a workspace context
, where user roles, UID, and metadata are often handled more dynamically.
I did not find the API’s for this scenario
Workspaces allow bulk user import
 via CSV or Excel files, typically through the 
Admin UI
Major Differences Between Pools and Workspaces
Feature/Aspect
Pools (Classic SecureAuth)
Workspaces (Modern Identity Platform / Arculix)
Use Case
Used for grouping SecureAuth 
realms
, 
users
, and configurations
Designed for 
modern identity management
, user creation, bulk import, and delegated admin
Management Style
Mostly 
configuration-based
, via SecureAuth Admin panel or config files
Modern, 
UI-first
 with bulk import and REST API support
Multi-Tenant Support
Limited — pools mainly used for internal grouping
Full multi-tenant support — separate teams or clients can use isolated Workspaces
User Import
Typically through 
LDIF
, 
custom scripts
, or directory sync
CSV Import directly via UI; JSON via API
MFA & Policies
Defined per realm/pool
Defined per workspace
Admin Access Control
Admins can access based on realms and pools
Admin access can be scoped 
per workspace
 for better delegation and control
Future Direction
Legacy, still supported but not actively enhanced
Recommended for 
new implementations
 — SecureAuth is investing in Workspace enhancements
When to Use What:
Scenario
Recommendation
You are maintaining a 
legacy SecureAuth deployment
Use 
Pools
You are setting up a 
new identity and access management environment
Use 
Workspaces
You need 
delegated administration
, clean UI, or plan for 
multi-tenancy
Use 
Workspaces
 
 Below are a few APIs that are useful for integrating
New User creation
User Store Config API
/api/identity/default/system/pools/{ipID}/users
/api/identity/default/admin/pools/{ipID}/users
Delete the User account
User Store Config API
/api/identity/default/system/pools/{ipID}/users/{userID}
 
Get the User details
User Store Config API
/api/identity/default/system/pools/{ipID}/users/{userID}
 
Update the User record
User Store Config API
/api/identity/default/system/pools/{ipID}/users/{userID}
 
Change password
User Account API
            
/api/identity/default/system/pools/{ipID}/users/{userID}/change_password
Request Reset password – if required
User Store Config API
/api/identity/default/system/pools/{ipID}/user/password/reset/request
Use 
Pools
 when strict user isolation is required (e.g., multi-tenant architecture).
Use 
Workspaces
 when you need 
role-based management
, 
bulk operations
, or 
cross-pool capabilities
.
Need Clarifications:
Q1. The APIs listed in the documentation for user creation are all under pools. Do we have any other APIs that support user creation under a workspace?
Here are the Docs link:
User Store Config API
User Admin API
Q2. For bulk user creation, I tried using the required fields: email or phone, payload.first_name, and payload.last_name. I would also like to use Uid as an identifier, along with passwords and roles.
If we want to include additional attributes like these, how should they be structured in the Excel file?
I attempted the following format, but it only processed the email, first_name, and last_name fields:
email	payload.first_name	payload.last_name	metadata.roles	identifiers.Uid	credentials.password
Is there a reference template or guide available that outlines the correct structure for all supported attributes?
Q3. Are there any APIs available for creating users under Workspaces? The docs only mention Pool-related endpoints.
Q4. When we tried obtaining an API token using the endpoint /default/admin/oauth2/token, we received a "resource not found" error. Could this be due to missing permissions or an incorrect configuration? Is there a different endpoint we should be using, considering this one is under the "admin" path?
