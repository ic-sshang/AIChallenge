Purpose and Scope
This domain automates provisioning and updates the entire infrastructure via a CI/CD pipeline. It orchestrates Terraform Workflow (init → plan → apply) across environments, enforces policy checks, and provides auditability and repeatability.
Architecture
Pipeline Implementation:
 
 Please fill 
this
 and the 
operations and runbook sections
 as briefly as you can. I am not aware of these procedures yet. Please pull in whomsoever has knowledge on these, if necessary.
Security and Access Controls
Service Principal
 scoped to a least-privilege role (e.g. “Contributor” on target RGs).  
Credentials
 stored securely in Jenkins/Azure DevOps Vault.  
Manual approval
 gate for non-dev environments prevents unintended changes.  
Audit logs
 enabled at Azure subscription and CI server level.
Operations and Runbook (Placeholder Steps for now)
#1 Commit Terraform code and modules to Git → triggers CI.  
#2. Monitor pipeline:  
  – Init/Plan stages validate syntax & show diffs.  
  – On dev: auto-apply; on higher envs: await approval.  
#3. Post-apply: verify resources in Azure Portal / Cloudflare Dashboard.  
#4. Rollback: revert Git commit, re-run pipeline.  
Troubleshooting:
  – 
Init failures
 → check backend credentials & network access.  
  – 
Plan errors
 → inspect variable validation and state consistency.  
  – 
Apply permission
 → ensure SPN has correct RBAC on target RG.
