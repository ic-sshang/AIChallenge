 Got good roadmap items until December.
Team was able to finish all planned work items inspite of having unplanned slack webhook updates
Good balance between speed and quality in deliveries of stories.
Got the opportunity to explore new areas and grow through hands-on tasks.
Playwright automation framework has been set up for ICChaseFundingAPI, with Azure Functions integrated into the pipeline.
All automation items got closed as planned
Good improvement in the burndown chart. This improves the cycle time. We should continue to do this.
 Leaked some issues to production in slack updates ticket. Test thoroughly when something is releasing to production, otherwise its a rework with respect to fixing, testing and deploying to prod.
 Plan in advance on the dependencies.
 Manoj and Tanvi for taking slack items as priority and completing them successfully along with actual planned items
I really appreciate the entire team for their guidance and consistent support which helped me in completing my stories on time and also had lots of learnings.
