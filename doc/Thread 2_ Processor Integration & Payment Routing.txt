Medium Rocks (MVP vs Day‑1 vs Future)
How to Read the Table
Rows = Capabilities (Big Rocks)
 → Each row is a core capability (e.g., Wizard, KYC, Funding Config). Marked as 
Must
 or 
Should
 from workshops.
Columns = Phases of Readiness
MVP = Regulatory Baseline
 → Minimum controls required by Chase/regulators. Manual, Ops-driven. Goal: 
Legally live
 (1–3 billers).
Day-1 = Operational Baseline
 → Minimal automation to support ~20 billers. Light UI/API builds. Goal: 
Operationally viable
.
Day-90+ = Optimization & Scale
 → Efficiency, self-service, advanced integrations. Goal: 
Reduce manual work & scale growth
.

Description
MVP (Regulatory Baseline – Shadow + Pilot Billers in Real Mode)
Day-1 (Operational Baseline ~20 Billers)
Day-90+ (Optimization & Scale)
Open Questions / Decisions / Blockers
Chase Commerce Payments API 
Core PayFac API for Visa/MC/Disc (auth/capture/void/refund). Must carry MO#. 
MoSCoW: Must
.
🔴 Pilot billers (1–3) live in Real Mode on Chase Commerce. 
🔴 Shadow Mode duplicates Orbital traffic.
🔴 Idempotency + adapter isolation baked in.
🔴Generate & persist 
sent_to_cis_at
 flag at txn level for funding eligibility.
🔴 Expand Real Mode to ~20 billers. Retries, error taxonomy, Ops dashboard. Shadow continues for canary cohorts.
🔴 Event-driven/webhooks (replace polling). Circuit breakers, fallback, extended observability.
Blocker:
 Chase CAT sandbox/API specs not provisioned. 
Next Step:
 Payments Eng + Chase agree on certification plan.
Settlement & Reporting Ingestion
Ingest Chase settlement files; reconcile to txn ledger by MO#; feeds Finance and downstream Funding engine. 
MoSCoW: Must
.
🔴 Enhance existing Chase settlement feed ingestion for PayFac schema. 
🔴 Map Commerce data to MO#-based ledger for pilot billers. 
🔴
 
Include CIS delivery flags (
sent_to_cis
) to support funding gate.
🔴 Finance validates payouts vs expected funding. 
🔴 
Note: Outputs feed into Funding & Fee Routing Engine (covered in Thread 3).
🔴 Automated ingestion + reconciliation for ~20 billers; exception workflows; outputs feed Funding & Fee Routing Engine (Thread 3).
🔴 Finance dashboards; automated dispute/refund tie-outs.
Blocker:
 Chase field map TBD. 
Next Step:
 Finance + Eng finalize schema.
Merchant Order Number (MO#) Strategy
Universal ID (BID + invoice type + suffix). Enables routing, reporting, reconciliation. 
MoSCoW: Must
.
🔴 Spec finalized + enforced from MVP. ID service generates/validates MO# across all processors/rails. All Shadow + Pilot biller txns tagged for reconciliation across Orbital + Chase Commerce (
all rails
).
🟡 Ops dashboards + reconciliation tooling layered on top of MO#. Cohort routing uses MO#.
🔴 Extended MO# model supports super-billers, versioning, advanced analytics.
Blocker:
 How to handle shopping carts with multiple invoice types. Options: (1) multiple MO#s per cart vs. (2) composite MO# encoding invoice types. Chase only echoes a single MO#; length limits (~40 chars) constrain composite design. 
Next Step:
 Align with Chase (Jen’s note) + finalize ID strategy for multi-invoice carts before pilots.
Settlement Mode Config (Gross / Net / Daily Fee Debit)
Defines how Chase/IC apply payouts and fees: gross, net, or daily debit. 
MoSCoW: Must
.
🔴 Core logic in MVP. Ops applies configs for pilot billers; validates modes in live payouts.
🟡 Governance & scale controls (cohort-level config, validation rules, approval workflows) required to manage 20+ billers. 
Detail covered in Thread 3 (Funding & Payout)
 where the Funding Engine executes these rules.
🔴 Granular config per invoice/rail. Premium fast funding. Dynamic rules (risk-tier or reserve-driven).
Blocker:
 
Finance policy decision required
 – which biller cohorts must operate net vs gross (e.g., Amex aggregator vs Chase rails). 
Next Step:
 Finance define Day-1 settlement policies. 
Engineering Recommendation:
 Start with Gross and build Net for Day-90
Amex Processing Path
Determine Day-1 path (OptBlue vs aggregator vs direct). Dependency on Chase/Amex. 
MoSCoW: Must
.
🟢 Pilot billers continue on legacy Amex aggregator. MO# tagging ensures reconciliation.
🔴 Chosen path (likely OptBlue fallback) integrated for Day-1 cohorts.
🔴 Unified Amex reconciliation across all paths.
Blocker:
 Amex/Chase roadmap unresolved. 
Next Step:
 Exec escalation + fallback plan.
POS/Card-Present (Bluefin vs Datacap)
Decide CP vendor; ~30–40% of billers use POS. 
MoSCoW: Should
.
— Out of MVP unless a pilot requires POS. Bluefin remains legacy. 
🟡 Vendor path chosen (Datacap pilot if Bluefin blocked). Ops runbook for POS billers.
🔴 Integrated POS lifecycle: device onboarding, tokenization, deactivation.
Blocker:
 Bluefin not PF-certified.
 
Next Step:
 Evaluate Datacap pilot; comms to POS billers.
Non-Chase Rails Orchestration (PayPal, Hyperwallet, etc.)
Must support non-Chase methods. 
MoSCoW: Should
.
🟢 Pilot billers continue on legacy rails. Ops runbooks + CRM placeholders. MO# tagging ensures reconciliation.
🟡 Minimal orchestration in new stack; ensure MO# carried for reporting.
🔴 Full API adapters across non-Chase rails; consolidated dashboards.
Next Step:
 Product + Eng confirm PayPal/Hyperwallet specs.
