Overview
Layered architecture offers several benefits that make it a popular choice for designing software systems. Here are some key advantages:
Separation of Concerns
:
Each layer in the architecture has a specific responsibility, which helps in organizing the codebase and making it more manageable. This separation allows developers to focus on one aspect of the application at a time
.
Modularity
:
Layers can be developed, tested, and maintained independently. This modularity makes it easier to update or replace parts of the system without affecting other layers.
Reusability
:
Common functionalities can be encapsulated in a single layer and reused across different parts of the application. 
Maintainability
:
With a clear structure and separation of concerns, the system becomes easier to maintain. Bugs can be isolated and fixed within specific layers without impacting the entire system.
Scalability
:
Layers can be scaled independently.  For example, if using a API first approach with a web UI, the presentation layer is deployed separately and can be scaled differently than the API.
Testability
:
Each layer can be tested in isolation, making it easier to write and execute tests.
Flexibility
:
Changes in one layer do not necessarily impact other layers, allowing for greater flexibility in making modifications and enhancements
.
Specialization
:
Teams can specialize in different layers, allowing for more focused expertise and efficient development processes.  For example, front end developers and backend developers.
Presentation Layer
 
Business Logic Layer
 
Not all designs require a physical separation between the presentation and business logic layers.   You can still achieve a lot of the benefits of a layered designed by separating layers via modularity (class libraries and executing assemblies)
Interaction Between Layers
The Presentation Layer sends user input to the Business Logic Layer.
The Business Logic Layer processes the input, applies business rules, and interacts with the Data Access Layer if needed.
The Business Logic Layer sends the processed data back to the Presentation Layer for display.
This separation of concerns helps in maintaining, scaling, and testing the application more efficiently.
