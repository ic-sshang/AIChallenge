Verify that a existing MyIIS session can be assumed by the 1.5 Payer Portal.
Biller Option 139 needs to be enabled in the CRM for the Biller’s Payer users to redirect from the legacy page to the 1.5 Payer Portal page.
The URL MyIIS uses to redirect to the 1.5 Payer Portal is set in its web.config file.  The deployment pipeline for MyIIS will get a value from a ADO library group “DevTest”, “UAT”, or “Production” and inject the library value into the web.config.
<add key="PayerPortalBaseUrl" value="https://payer-ui-v2.dev.invoicecloud.com/payer/pyrprtl0/" />
The URL the 1.5 Payer Portal uses for the MyIIS session API is set as a ENV variable.  The value used are stored in ADO library groups (
pyrprtl-dev
, 
pyrptl-iat
, 
pyrprt-qar
, 
pyrptl-xat
, 
pyrptl-prd
) for each environment.  These values are seeded into the dedicated environment application level key vaults using seed pipelines for each environment.  The k8s pods are configured to use the k8s key vault secret provider for the source of environment variables.
