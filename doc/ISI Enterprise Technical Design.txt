BillerSettledBatchSummarySOAP
BillerSettledBatchDetailSOAP
To pull a list of settled batches.
If ISI finds a settled batch they have not seen before, they use this secondary service to download a list of payments and link them together into a batch for bank reconciliation.
The frequency is set by each company but these services are typically called every 2-5 minutes with a cutoff date/time set to the time of the previous run. The services do not take a FromGMT parameter so ISI could be pulling years of batches on every run.
