Yes, if paying with bank account, I’m prompted to make a donation to Share the Light Fund

🤔 Overall Impressions
What was impressive?
The initial Duke site feels clean and modern. Language is clear, bill is easy to understand.
What was frustrating?
Speedpay experience breaks easily. If you refresh you’re forced to go back to the main Duke site and start all over.
Would you trust this provider more or less after using the experience?
A little less – Speedpay feels very disconnected and frail. 
What does this platform do better or worse than InvoiceCloud?
Better:
Primary Duke site has an easy account lookup and sign in process. It’s easy to see usage. 
Worse:
Handoff to Speedpay is terrible, and the experience breaks easily. 
If you could “steal” one thing, what would it be?
The account lookup from the Duke site is extremely clear – I find my account, then I can get to my invoices.
What's the one area they outperform us in?
Clarity of email communications. Copy is minimal, all details and next steps are very clear.
