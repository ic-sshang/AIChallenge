Navigate to BillerWizardFinalize.aspx?billershardid={biller_shard_id} 
On Page Load, call 
selAzureBillers @BillerID={biller_shard_id}
 (DBMaster_GoldAzure) 
If the biller is not found, call 
CreateAzureBiller
 via Business Service, passing Shard ID + ShardHubName as args. 
CreateAzureBiller
 is invoked -> 
https://dev.azure.com/invoicecloud/Src/_git/CreateAzureBiller
 
The ShardHubName passed in (4.2). is used to connect to a SignalR Hub which provides real-time updates on status.  
Calls 
selCreateBillerShard @BillerShardID={biller_shard_id}
 (DBMaster_GoldAzure) which queries the 
CreateBillerShard
 table. 
CreateAzureBiller
 calls into a webhook in Azure - 
NewBillerAutomationWebHook
 -> NewBillerAutomationWebHookUrl and token are fetched from the devtest Keyvault 
IC-Automation/EnableNewBillerDB
 is invoked -> 
https://portal.azure.com/#@InvoiceCloud360.onmicrosoft.com/resource/subscriptions/c1e3635c-98d4-47f5-96e0-926717b6f0c4/resourceGroups/RG-SQL-Databases/providers/Microsoft.Automation/automationAccounts/IC-Automation/runbooks/EnableNewBillerDB/overview
 
The Runbook calls 
EXEC selCreateBillerShard
 (DBMaster_GoldAzure) again.  
The Runbook uses the Azure PowerShell 
New-AzSqlDatabaseCopy
 Cmdlet using the the information returned from 
selCreateBillerShard
 - this creates the Shard. i. In all cases - the template database used is 
NewBillerShard_mcl
 
The Runbook calls 
EXEC updCreateBillerShard
 (DBMaster_GoldAzure) and sets the Shard ID + DB_Created = 1 
The Runbook connects to the newly created Shard and calls 
EXEC spLoadBiller_Shard
EXEC spLoadBiller_Shard
 is invoked (IC-BillerShard) 
EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE
 -> The Stored Procedure runs a SQL Query on the dbo.Billers table in DBMaster_GoldAzure 
The result set of the executed query is used to populate the 'dbo.Billers' table in the Shard. 
dbo.BillerDomains
 (IC-BillerShard) is queried locally & a default row is inserted if nothing is present. 
BACK TO
 
IC-Automation/EnableNewBillerDB
 
The Runbook calls 
EXEC updCreateBillerShard
 (DBMaster_GoldAzure) and sets the Shard ID + Pool_Complete = 1 
The Runbook calls two PowerShell Cmdlets to add the new Shard to the Failover Group
Get-AzSqlDatabase
 -> Returns the Shard 
Add-AzSqlDatabaseToFailoverGroup
 -> Adds the Shard to the Failover Group 
The Runbook calls 
EXEC updCreateBillerShard
 again, passing 
@FG_Complete = 1
 
The Runbook connects to the Elastic Pool DB - 
IC-ElasticJobs
 and calls 
EXEC [jobs].[sp_add_target_group_member]
 with the Shard Database Name as a param 2x. 
The first call adds the Shard to the 'ic_shard_dbs' target group  
The second call adds the Shard to the 'ic_DeploymentGroup3' target group
BACK TO 
CreateAzureBiller
When control returns to 
CreateAzureBiller
, another update message is pushed out via SignalR to notify on progress.
A message is placed on an Azure Storage Queue - 
enablebiller-shard
 containing the Biller ID + Product & Database information.
The message placed in the 
enablebiller-shard
 queue is picked up by the 
Biller_CreateShardMapQT
 Azure function (in the 
IC-DB-ShardMap
 project) → 
Biller_CreateShardMapQT.cs - Repos
The new shard is added to the Shard Map in 
IC_ShardMapManagerDb
.
The function calls 
UPDATE Billers SET WebDomainID=2 WHERE BillerID=@BillerID
 to finally set the Biller’s 
WebDomainID = 2
.
BACK TO 
CreateAzureBiller
The job queries the biller record to check for 
WebDomainID = 2
.
selAzureBillers
 is invoked again to retrieve the Biller Record.
spCreateNewBiller
 is invoked and is parameterized based on information provided earlier in the Create Biller Wizard.
POLYBASE query - updates both DBMaster + Biller Shard
insPrdInvoicing_Master
 is invoked to update the 
prdInvoicing_Master
 table in DBMaster, inserting an Invoicing ID (scalar result of 
spCreateNewBiller
), the Biller ID, and Biller’s Virtual Path.
updBillers
 is called to set 
WebDomainID=2
 in the shard.
insBillerUsers
 is invoked with an empty password to create the first user account.'
updBillerUsers
 is invoked to change the password to an encrypted, randomly generated one.
This step also updates the 
ChangeLogs
 table.
dbo.insNewBillerRolesPermissionsData
 is invoked to create new Roles + Permissions in the Shard.
dbo.spInsUpdBillerMultiUserRolePermissions
 is then invoked twice, once to grant the new user the 
Admin
 role and a second time to grant the user the 
IC Admin
 role.
The 
PartnerID
 value is retrieved from the 
dbo.Billers
 table and used to call SkyNetAPI and apply INT360 settings.

Notes on potential process improvements for this area
760
5 outgoing stored proc calls on a single page load is a lot - this can be reduced significantly.
This process is a critical part of customer onboarding and demoing for sales, and it is one that appears to be easy to isolate.
First iteration
Create an API/Microservice
 that is specific to the 
Biller Wizard
 - e.g. 
BillerWizard
 API.
The API should have a single query endpoint that aggregates & returns all of the necessary data to display the page, reducing the # of calls from 5 to 1 (GraphQL?).
API endpoints should be introduced where necessary for page data changes - for example, changing the 
Software Integrator Partner
 field executes an additional stored procedure call 
itg.selIntegratorProfiles
 and changes the display based on the result.
The 
dbo.selEmployees
 call should be removed entirely and instead retrieve the active user’s email from an Auth token minted by an API and stored in the browser/session.
A single endpoint, associated to a command (
CreateBiller
, 
ProvisionBiller
, 
RegisterBiller
, etc.) should be used to initiate the process of creating a Biller Shard & completing the initial seeding.
Much of the behavior from 
CreateAzureBiller
 can be moved into this microservice, especially the SignalR behavior.
Introduce Redis Cache
The 
BillerWizardAPI
 will leverage Redis cache to store a copy of the data used to display the page - Integrators, Integrator Profiles, Sales Reps, Authentication Types, TimeZones
TimeZones and Integrator Profiles, specifically, are perfect items to keep in the cache.
Initially configure the Cache Set with a Sliding + Absolute Expiration. The 
BillerWizardAPI
 should ALWAYS own its copy of the data in Redis & handle the invalidation of these items when necessary.
Redis Data Types
Integrators → 
List
 of objects
Integrator Profiles → 
Set
 - 
Key: Integrator_ID, Value: Integrator Profile
Sales Reps → 
List
 of objects
Authentication Types → 
List
 of objects
Timezones → 
List
 of objects
Introduce a SignalR Instance in 
rg-glb-resources1-{env}
This instance will replace the one currently in use for legacy infrastructure.
The 
BillerWizardAPI
 will use this SignalR Service in Azure to push real-time updates on the Biller setup process.
Subsequent iteration(s)
BillerWizardAPI
Should issue a command to another API that will begin the integrations process for setting up a new Biller - 
CreateBillerShard
 or 
CreateBillerInfrastructure
, etc.
Redis Cache
Processes that update any of Integrators, Sales Reps, Authentication Types, or TimeZones should be modified to emit events that 
BillerWizardAPI
 can subscribe to and use to invalidate the cache on-demand.  
2. CRM - BillerWizardFinalize
After the 
Submit
 button is clicked on the 
BillerWizardStart
 page, form fields are validated, and all procedure calls have finished, the page redirects the user to the 
BillerWizardFinalize
 page where another stored procedure is invoked to check for the existence of necessary Biller records in 
DBMaster_GoldAzure
.
Stored Procedure
ASPX VB Method
Table(s)
dbo.selAzureBillers
BillerWizardFinalize_Load()
dbo.Billers
dbo.BillerDomains
dbo.tblDomainTypes
dbo.tblDomains
dbo.tblVirtualApplications
(Joined in place of 
dbo.Billers
 if 
BillerID == ''
 or 
BillerGUID == ''
)
If nothing is returned from the 
dbo.selAzureBillers
 stored procedure, 
CreateAzureBiller
 is invoked through the 
BusinessService
 method 
RunScheduledJob
.
3. CreateAzureBiller
 The request to 
CreateAzureBiller
 is proxied through 
ICBusinessService
 and the 
RunScheduledJob
 method performs the task it indicates. The execution of the job can be found in 
IC.Business.Scheduler
.
Two params are passed to 
CreateAzureBiller
 - 
AzureBillerShardID
 + 
ShardHubName
.
The 
AzureBillerShardID
 reflects the 
BillerID
 while 
ShardHubName
 is the name of a SignalR hub which status messages are pushed to during the provisioning process.
If the 
AzureBillerShardID
 is valid - the process will invoke 
selCreateBillerShard
 which either returns the data contained in 
dbo.CreateBillerShard
 or it updates the corresponding Biller Record in the table, setting the 
ProcessStart
 col with the current Timestamp, before returning the data.
The process then invokes the 
IC-Automation/EnableNewBillerDB
 webhook contained in Azure - which performs additional downstream work to set up the new Shard database.
NOTE - The 
IC-Automation/EnableNewBillerDB
 Webhook performs work in the background while this process continues along, polling tables until the Webhook finishes running.

4. IC-Automation/EnableNewBillerDB Webhook
The webhook begins by setting up a call to 
dbo.selCreateBillerShard
 - which retrieves the information from the 
dbo.CreateBillerShard
 table in 
DBMaster_GoldAzure
 and then executes the following process:
Execute Azure PowerShell Cmdlet 
New-AzSqlDatabaseCopy
 to create the new Biller Shard from a Golden Database - 
NewBillerShard_mcl
 
powershell
New-AzSqlDatabaseCopy `
  -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName ` # "RG-SQL-Databases"
  -ServerName $ServerName `               # "ic-db-east-server1"

  -CopyResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName  `
  -CopyServerName $ServerName `
  -CopyDatabaseName $NewDBName 
Execute 
dbo.updCreateBillerShard
 - set 
DB_Created = 1
Execute 
dbo.spLoadBiller_Shard
in the newly created Biller Shard.
This stored procedure makes an external call to 
DBMaster_GoldenAzure
 to fetch the Biller row from 
dbo.Billers
 - 
SELECT * FROM Billers WHERE BillerID = @BillerID
 - and then executes a 
MERGE
 to load the row into the Shard’s 
dbo.Billers
 table.
The stored procedure also loads a default row into 
dbo.BillerDomains
Execute 
dbo.updCreateBillerShard
 again - set 
Pool_Complete = 2
Execute PowerShell Cmdlet 
Add-AzSqlDatabaseToFailoverGroup
 to add the Shard to the failover group.
powershell
$failovergroup = Get-AzSqlDatabase `
  -ResourceGroupName $primaryresourcegroupname `
  -ServerName $primaryservername `
  -DatabaseName $databasename | `

  -ServerName $primaryservername `
  -FailoverGroupName $failovergroupname
  $failovergroup
Execute 
dbo.updCreateBillerShard
 again - set 
FG_Complete = 1
Execute 
jobs.sp_add_target_group_member
 in 
IC-ElasticJobs
 to add the shard to 
ic_shard_dbs
 group.
Execute

5. CreateAzureBiller
During the execution of the 
IC-Automation/EnableNewBillerDB
 webhook, the 
CreateAzureBiller
 job repeatedly invokes the 
dbo.selAzureBillers
 stored procedure, around every 8 seconds, up to a maximum of 3 minutes. When the 
dbo.selAzureBillers
 stored proc returns a row, it breaks out of the loop and prepares a call to 
dbo.spCreateNewBiller
 in the newly provisioned Biller Shard.
Create a call to 
spCreateNewBiller

Make a call to 
dbo.updBillerUsers
This call updates the User record with an updated, encrypted password and also updates the record with a Biller User ID.
The partner ID is retrieved from the completed Biller Row, if it’s available
If it is not available, 
SELECT PartnerID FROM dbo.Billers WHERE BillerID = @BillerID
 is executed and the 
PartnerID
 returned here is used in subsequent steps.
A POST request is made the SkyNet API using the BillerID + PartnerID to finish the INT360 setup for the Biller.
