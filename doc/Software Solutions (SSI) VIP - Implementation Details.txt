Coding Requirements
Invoice Cloud Coding Requirements
NONE - No coding done by IC because SSI has coded to IC formats and web services. IM is responsible for completing the Integration Summary and setting up the BIF Customizations in CRM and ensure that 'Apply Global BIF Customizations' is checked in CRM on the Invoicing / Advanced Configuration page.
IC will no longer load historical data for billers that convert from eGOV to VIP due to the account number changing.
