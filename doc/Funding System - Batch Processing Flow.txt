Problem Statement
The current design for our batch funding job has two main issues that can lead to errors and financial loss.
1. Stale Funding Instructions
The funding instructions sent to the API can become 
stale
 because critical details—such as the payout amount or bank account information—can change after the batch job has run. This creates a risk of funding the wrong amount or sending money to an incorrect or outdated bank account.
The system must ensure that when a batch of payments is scheduled for funding, all instructions are current and accurate at the precise moment of execution.
2. Timing and Data Freshness
The second issue is a matter of timing and data freshness, particularly concerning ACH payments and changing bank details.
Payment Rejection Risk:
 ACH payments can be rejected up to two business days after being initiated. Funding these payments too early could mean sending money for a transaction that will ultimately fail, leading to unnecessary effort and potential financial complications.
Outdated Biller Information:
 
Biller bank account details often change. The Nacha Funding Job must fetch the most recent bank account information for a payout as close as possible to the moment it creates the Nacha file to ensure the funds are routed correctly.
In short, the system needs to guarantee that funding instructions are created and sent only when we have a high degree of confidence that the payments are valid and that all associated data (like bank account details) is up-to-the-minute.
