file shares
Pre-Provisioning
We’ve got a number of directories exposed as file shares. Some are used by applications, others are there to let engineers peek into the servers without granting login access.
The below list details all shares on our current production servers. We should match these. We’ll need to create these directories and register them as shares. I believe this can be done in the image build, but may need to shift to post provisioning. 
C:\                                        # default (no need to configure)
C:\Data\WWW                                # web application files
C:\Temp                                    # why would we need this?
C:\Windows                                 # default (no need to configure)
D:\                                        # default (no need to configure)
E:\                                        # default (no need to configure)
E:\Data\AppData                            # this is 'IC_APPDATA_DIR'
E:\Data\AppData\Data\Files\Processed       # used by several Stratus-related apps
E:\Data\AppData\Files\Processed            # used by several Stratus-related apps
E:\Data\AppData\Files\StratusDump          # used by several Stratus-related apps
E:\Data\AppData\Files\StratusExportDump    # used by several Stratus-related apps
E:\Data\Apps                               # scheduled task app files - 'IC_APPS_DIR'
E:\Data\Logs                               # 'IC_LOGS_DIR'
E:\inetpub\logs\logfiles                   # lets our engineers view IIS logs without logging in
