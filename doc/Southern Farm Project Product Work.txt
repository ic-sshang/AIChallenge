To allow a partial amount entered for payment in a partner’s portal to carry over to IC in CloudPayV2 and Show the amount that was entered as the payment option so the payer can move easily through the payment workflow.
5/7
They will have to code for a new field in the CloudPay V2 API. This field will essentially knock out the other payment options - so what they enter on their side overrides options for anything over than "Pay Other Amount”

Our end goal for this item is to accept an "allow" paperless and/or autopay sign up flag in the one time payment route, so that payers only sign up for paperless or autopay within SFB and then cannot change their preference in one time pay. We will accept a flag and grey out the paperless and or autopay sign ups.
Just how that flag is being passed and documenting on the decision.
