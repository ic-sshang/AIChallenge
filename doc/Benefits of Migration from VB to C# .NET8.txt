.NET 8 Compatibility and Long-Term Support
 
VB.NET isn't fully supported in .NET 8 and beyond. Microsoft has shifted its focus to C#, which means new features, performance improvements, and long-term support are primarily centered around the C# language. C# is the default for .NET Core and later (.NET 5+), giving us better compatibility, tooling, and access to the latest APIs. 
Cross-Platform Development
 
C# is designed for building cross-platform applications, whether for web, desktop, mobile, or cloud. It is the preferred language in cross-platform frameworks such as .NET MAUI (mobile and desktop), Blazor (web), ASP.NET Core (web APIs and services), and Unity (games and simulations). VB.NET remains largely confined to the Windows ecosystem, which limits its suitability for modern, cross-platform development needs. Migrating to C# expands our ability to build and deploy on Linux, macOS, Windows, Android, iOS, and the web.
 
Strong Ecosystem and Community Support
 
C# boasts a much larger and more active development community compared to VB.NET . The ecosystem around C# is robust, with a wide range of libraries, frameworks, sample code, tutorials, and community contributions readily available. Most modern tools, libraries, and third-party packages are developed for C# first—if not exclusively. This strong support system makes development faster, smoother, and more future-ready.
 
Better Performance and Tooling
 
C# is optimized for high performance in the .NET runtime and offers better support from modern development environments like Visual Studio. Features such as code analyzers, advanced IntelliSense, AI-powered suggestions, auto-refactoring, and diagnostic tools are more mature and stable in C#. Developers benefit from faster feedback loops and improved productivity when working in a well-supported language like C#.
 
Modern Development Frameworks Prefer C#
 
Most modern .NET frameworks and libraries—including Entity Framework Core, ASP.NET Core, Azure SDKs, Blazor, and .NET MAUI—are either not available in VB.NET  or only offer limited support. These frameworks are central to building scalable, cloud-ready, and cross-platform applications in today’s environment. Migrating to C# allows us to fully leverage these technologies without running into compatibility or feature limitations.
 
Codebase Consistency and Maintainability
 
Migrating the entire codebase to C# ensures greater consistency across the application, which is especially important when integrating with shared libraries, reusable components, or NuGet packages. Having a uniform codebase simplifies onboarding for new developers, improves maintainability, and reduces context switching. It also aligns better with CI/CD tooling, build automation, and platform-neutral development workflows.
 
Access to Modern Language Features
C# continues to evolve with powerful and expressive language features that are either unavailable or only partially available in VB.NET. Features like pattern matching, record types, async streams, top-level statements, nullability support, and more contribute to writing cleaner, more efficient, and maintainable code. Adopting C# opens the door to these modern features, helping developers work more productively and with fewer bugs.
Improved Testing Capabilities
 
C# has superior integration with modern unit testing and mocking frameworks such as xUnit, NUnit, MSTest, Moq, NSubstitute, and FluentAssertions. These tools follow C# syntax and design patterns closely, making test writing more expressive and powerful. Testing workflows, test discovery, debugging, and automation in CI/CD pipelines are also better supported in C#, which leads to higher test coverage and better application quality over time.
