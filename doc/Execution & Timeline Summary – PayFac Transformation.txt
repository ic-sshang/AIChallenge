Capacity Model Assumption:
 3 core delivery teams, ~90 pts/program sprint.
Alpha – Regulatory Baseline (1–3 Billers)
Execution Focus:
 Establish regulatory baseline so IC can legally process as a PayFac. Pilots live, consolidated deposits confirmed.
Scope:
Core Chase Commerce API integration.
Nightly Funding Orchestrator (NACHA).
Manual onboarding/KYC/AML; Ops-triggered screening.
Basic reconciliation + Finance tie-outs.
Effort:
 ~810 pts (9 program sprints).
Timeline:
 
Sep 2025 → Feb 2026.
Launch Timeline
: Q1 2026
Risks:
Chase environment readiness
: dependency on Chase sandbox environments
Scope creep & unknowns:
 baseline ledger, reporting, gates and ACH reject handling could expand.
Cross-team dependencies
Notes: 
ops team payfac vs non-payfac support/maintenance
Migration timeline expectation from execs
Beta – Operational Baseline (~20 Billers)
Execution Focus:
 Move from regulatory readiness to operational stability — Ops can support ~20 billers daily without chaos.
Scope:
Day-1 Biller Portal with onboarding form, SFDC integration, invoice visibility.
API-driven KYC/OFAC persisted in CRM; Ops dashboard for Chase screening.
Expand Chase Commerce to ~20 billers.
Ops/Finance dashboards for eligibility, funding, and exceptions.
Effort:
 ~915 pts (10.2 program sprints).
Duration:
 ~20 weeks.
Timeline:
 
March 2026 → July 2026.
Launch Timeline
: Q3 2026
Risks:
Amex routing strategy
 (OptBlue vs aggregator) still fluid –> may require dual integration paths.
POS 
path forward still fluid
Delivery risk if we don’t plan and prioritize iteration
Cross-team dependencies:
 Integration, database, biller, and payer teams need to be involved
Scope creep/unknowns:
 dashboards, exception handling, and funding gates could expand beyond current estimates.
Resourcing:
 May require 
temporary expansion (Payments India team)
