Stratus Web Services - Out of Memory Exception
Subject: [New Relic] Azure - StratusWebServices - McLogin query result is > 2.0 on 'System Out Of Memory Exception'
Alert email box: 
alert@invoicecloud.opsgenie.net
SME: 
Description: There was a request to StratusWebServices that caused an out of memory exception. This is usually caused by a biller uploading a very large file (400MB+). There is a Stratus client update which will zip files before sending which should mitigate this issue.
Common Issues:
In the alert, look for the IP address in the StratusFileProcessor table in the IC_Perflogging DB for the biller ID.
Stratus client will auto retry file uploads based on the stratus task setup in CRM. The incident will close itself out if a retry to upload the file succeeds (usually 2-3x).
In the event the alert stays open, CS should be contacted to get the file manually and install 
Stratus 2.6
 which has the file zipping code.
