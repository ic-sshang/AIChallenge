Enhance Security
Key Result 1
: Audit SonarQube and Contrast and security reporting for an existing system allocated to your assigned engineering teams and purpose and implement at least two improvements to address existing critical vulnerabilities (use Jira item workflow).
Key Result 2
: Establish regular SonarQube and Contrast security reviews for systems allocated to  your assigned engineering teams, target 100% compliance of no introduction of new security vulnerabilities  (use Jira item workflow).
Key Result 3: 
Enhance k8s build pipelines to scan newly created container images for CVEs, critical CVEs fail the build (use Jira item workflow).
Architect Program
Key Result 1
: Hook into the roadmap / discovery meeting (not grooming) process for any new project level work with your assigned engineering teams (required collaborators Tech Lead and Product Manager).
Key Result 2: 
Publish shared service (charter) definition, code repository scope, and team resource allocation in Confluence (Engineering Architecture)
Key Result 3: 
Develop a training program for the architect track for career growth
