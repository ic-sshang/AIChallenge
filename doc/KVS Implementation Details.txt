Test Portals
IC Hosted Test Portal - N/A

Rules of Engagement
No need to contact KVS as long as biller can pull the sample files themselves. The biller should be able to get support from KVS, if needed. 
Timeline
~60-90 days 
Configuration
Invoice Types
Invoice Types are mapped based on where the invoice file(s) are placed on the SFTP. Since the biller has two separate invoice files for school and city tax, the invoice type ID is configured based on file location.

Allow Adjustments on Closed Invoices
Enable this option if Payments and Adjustments can be applied to an Invoice that is considered closed. There are cases in which the recommended functionality is to disable this option. One case is Balance Forward, which by definition the balance of the previous Invoice is adjusted out and moved to the new Invoice. No more payments or adjustments should be allowed on that closed Invoice.
EXAMPLE
Enabled/Disabled
