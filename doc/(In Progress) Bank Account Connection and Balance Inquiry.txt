The Problem
There are two main problems we are tackling here; likely these will be broken out into two different projects.
Payers attempting to make a first time or one-time payment via their bank account often don’t know their Routing Number or Account Number. As a consequence, we introduce 1) friction into the payment process, 2) the opportunity to enter an incorrect routing/account number, and 3) the opportunity for errors in payment. 
Payers who use their bank account as their AutoPay payment method occasionally have insufficient funds available, resulting in ACH rejects. 
Why: How do we know this is a real problem and worth solving?
For payers needing to enter routing/account number, we know through customer interviews 
[DO WE HAVE A SOURCE]
 that this step can result in either abandoning the process entirely or moving to credit card as a payment method. Because fees are often higher in a submitter model, payers are unhappy about this. 
Approximately 5% 
[SOURCE THIS DATA]
 of ACH AutoPays are rejected. Part of those rejects 
[WHAT PART]
 are due to insufficient funds. 
Audience: Who are we building for?
We are building for 
payers
 who are:
Making a one-time payment via ACH
Setting up an AutoPay with ACH as payment method
We are also building for 
billers
 who are looking to reduce their ACH rejects.
We may be building for 
InvoiceCloud
 as well:
This could result in a feature we could charge for
We might be able to shift the balance of Credit Card vs. ACH payments, resulting in more profitable transactions for InvoiceCloud.
