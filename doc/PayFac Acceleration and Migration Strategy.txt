1. Objectives (non-negotiables)
Alpha:
 Deliver on time, hit Chase regulatory baseline, avoid derailment.
2026 Goal:
 All PSN migrated; IC billers showing credible momentum.
Board visibility:
 Demonstrate 
repeatability
 and throughput (not one-offs).
While Alpha is about protecting launch readiness, Beta is where we accelerate — pulling forward high‑impact capabilities and showing repeatability ahead of GA.
2. Protect Alpha (reduce delivery risk)
What we will not compromise:
Lock Alpha scope:
 No new functionality added; keep it strictly regulatory baseline
Shield Payments Engineering teams:
 Redirect or defer all non-PayFac asks (cross-team requests, infra asks, network/interchange updates). 
They can derail Alpha.
Resolve non-eng blockers early:
Chase due diligence responses, artifacts, and audit readiness.
CAT environment readiness for integrated testing. (We have a very narrow window)
Alpha billers identified and contracts prepared.
Beta/GA blockers – must be advanced in parallel with explicit deadlines and ownership:
IC migration cohorts identified with clear goals for 2026.
PSN migration strategy and execution plan defined, including tooling requirements and IC–PSN engineering partnership.
AmEx/OptBlue strategy clarified.
POS/Bluefin strategy defined/clarified.
Resource ahead:
Add India hires now — they can ramp in parallel and be repurposed post-GA, but they de-risk Beta acceleration without stealing Alpha capacity.
{US SE - RD to revist and think again}
 
Single throat to choke (or hand to shake):
 Clear ownership model for delivery, Ops/Compliance support, and escalation path for external dependencies.
👉 
Message:
 Alpha must land on time. It is the launch pad for board credibility. Everything else bends around that.
3. Migration Strategy
Clarity on IC and PSN migration strategies and cohorts is still emerging. Defining these plans quickly is critical to accelerate Beta and GA. Without a clear, repeatable migration model for PSN and IC billers,
 momentum stalls and scale cannot be achieved.
Why this matters:
Migration is the most visible proof point to the board and Chase that our PayFac model works.
Repeatability in migrations demonstrates that our onboarding, billing, funding, and compliance levers are functioning consistently.
Without clear cohorts and eligibility rules, every migration looks like a one-off, delaying momentum.
PSN:
Define cohorts based on implementation complexity, operational readiness, and biller profile (size, revenue impact, vertical risk).
Resolve data portability (tokens, IDs) and finalize POS/Bluefin strategy.
Establish repeatable batch tooling and cutover playbooks.
Decide PwC role (advisory vs. execution) and assign clear ownership.
IC:
Set clear goals and expectations for IC migration
 to maintain organizational focus and ensure progress can be measured and communicated.
Select high-revenue, lower-complexity billers early to show meaningful impact quickly.
Prioritize closing product disparity gaps (statements, billing detail, dispute workflows) so migrations are consistent.
Defer complex, one-off migrations until after repeatable process is proven.
Concrete cohort criteria:
Revenue impact:
 Prioritize billers that represent meaningful revenue uplift.
Complexity:
 Start with cohorts that avoid complex edge cases — e.g., no POS device migrations, no custom or mixed pricing models, no multi‑TIN super‑billers, and no unusual funding/statement requirements. These more complex migrations can be deferred until after a repeatable baseline process is proven.
Risk:
 Move low-risk verticals (utilities, government) first; defer high-risk until monitoring/reserve controls are GA-ready.
Product parity:
 Only migrate billers whose needs are supported by Beta features (e.g., billing visibility, chargeback intake).
Output:
 Cohort eligibility rules, migration tooling, and cutover playbooks = a repeatable migration playbook that demonstrates acceleration by showing PSN completed and IC momentum by EOY.
4. Scale Levers (Beta → GA) — What Repeatability Looks Like
These levers are the 
primary focus after Alpha launch
 — they ensure we don’t just deliver features, but create a repeatable, auditable path that every biller follows. By focusing here, we build the foundation for true repeatability in Beta and scalability in GA, making migrations predictable instead of one-offs.
Onboarding & Underwriting:
Beta: Ops-facing wizard, KYC API, SLA queues
These make onboarding predictable and auditable — every biller is boarded through the same automated checks.
Acceleration option:
 Explore dedicating Q1 priority from one of the Biller scrum teams to advance onboarding product development. Payments team can then fine‑tune after Alpha, giving a runway to speed Beta — but this would require a roadmap shift for Biller teams.
GA: Self-service portal, automatic account verification
Adds scalability so the same repeatable path applies to hundreds of billers without overwhelming Ops.
Acceleration option
: Potentially consider adding more onboarding Ops resources temporarily to handle the increased onboarding workload at scale while self-service matures. This can help advance GA readiness.
Processor Integration & Routing:
GA: Broaden dashboards for SLA/SLO monitoring; Add Finance dashboards for dispute/refund tie-outs; Potential 
AI report generation 
for recon and Ops team.
Adds scalability across all rails, enabling PSN and IC migrations at pace.
Risk: POS strategy and AmEx strategy must be clarified early; otherwise, assumptions made for Beta and GA will break down, significantly increasing workload and delaying Beta/GA milestones.
Funding & Payouts:
Beta: Unified Ledger, payout templates, CIS Funding gating, Ops dashboards.
Every biller’s funding follows the same ledgered template, creating a repeatable payout process.
GA: Risk-tier payout rules (velocity caps, auto-reserves, payout delays if risk triggers), automated exceptions.
Allows the same standardized process to safely scale to hundreds of billers.
Risk & Compliance:
Beta: Fraud/AML rules, Ops dashboards, chargeback intake.
Creates a consistent baseline risk check applied equally across all billers.
GA: Exception handling at scale → dashboards for Chase and non-Chase rails (unified view); Unified Ops/Compliance dashboard consolidating fraud, AML, chargeback alerts.
Elevates consistency into scalable controls that regulators and Chase can trust.
Billing & 1099:
Beta: Daily Chase fee ingestion, invoice engine, portal visibility.
Ensures every migrated biller receives fees in the same standardized format — proving repeatability.
GA: Multi-processor ingestion, ACH auto-debit, 1099 reporting/workflow
Extends the same model to all processors and billers, reducing manual Finance intervention. Additional resourcing may be required in Billing & Finance teams to accelerate these capabilities.
5. Acceleration Strategy
Acceleration is not automatic with existing capacity. It requires intentional actions across engineering and non-engineering functions to create capacity, remove friction, and deliver GA-level capabilities earlier where they unblock PSN/IC migrations.
Key actions to execute acceleration:
Resource addition:
 Add targeted engineering pods and expand Ops/Finance headcount to absorb migration and billing volumes. 
Pull forward GA items selectively:
 Focus only on those that directly unblock PSN/IC migrations. Do not overload Beta with any nice-to-haves.  
Incremental Beta drops:
 Define visible milestones 
(Drop 1: onboarding wizard MVP; Drop 2: fee ingestion + invoice engine; Drop 3: dispute intake + debit/re-credit). 
Third-party vendors:
 Explore leveraging targeted partners where they can truly accelerate timelines. Examples: 
POS/Bluefin partners for device mapping and certification. {specifically for PSN}
Chargeback, Risk Monitoring 
{Need to explore more}
PwCfor migration support; {plan/impact yet to be assessed}
Cross-functional readiness:
 Require Legal (contracts, auto-debit terms), Finance (reconciliation and invoicing authority), Customer Success (biller communications and training), and Compliance (governance, re-KYC cadence) to move in lockstep with Engineering.
👉 
Acceleration is achieved by adding resources, using vendors to shortcut capability gaps, sequencing Beta delivery into drops with KPIs, and aligning the entire organization. It is not achieved by reshuffling features with the same constrained capacity.
6. Cross-Functional Dependencies
Acceleration depends on more than engineering: {not an exhaustive list}
Legal:
 Updated contracts and paperwork.
Finance:
 Ability to handle auto‑debits, billing dispute resolution
Ops:
 Playbooks for exceptions, KYC remediation, dispute intake.
Customer Success:
 Billers informed, migration support and training provided.
Compliance:
 Governance framework, re‑KYC cadence, sanctions monitoring.
Bottomline
Alpha must not slip.
Expand resources strategically across engineering and supporting functions to ensure timely delivery.
Establish clear migration cohorts and 
measurable goals
:
PSN:
 all billers migrated.
IC:
 cohorts prioritized using defined impact metrics, some examples:
Top 20% of billers by revenue contribution.
Billers representing ≥30% of transaction volume.
Cohorts that address critical product gaps (e.g., billing detail, statements).
Initial focus on high-revenue, low-complexity utilities/insurance billers; defer complex migrations such as multi-TIN super-billers, heavily customized setups, or unusual funding models until later.
Define targets such as migrating cohorts that represent X% of revenue or Y% of the customer base to demonstrate board-visible momentum.
Beta must demonstrate 
repeatability 
through visible drops and defined KPIs.
GA readiness should be accelerated by prioritizing and delivering a few high-impact features that enable 
scale
.
Success depends on full organizational readiness across Legal, Finance, Ops, Customer Success, and Compliance, not solely on Engineering.
