Medium Rocks (MVP vs Day‑1 vs Future)
How to Read the Table
Rows = Capabilities (Big Rocks)
 → Each row is a core capability (e.g., Wizard, KYC, Funding Config). Marked as 
Must
 or 
Should
 from workshops.
Columns = Phases of Readiness
MVP = Regulatory Baseline
 → Minimum controls required by Chase/regulators. Manual, Ops-driven. Goal: 
Legally live
 (1–3 billers).
Day-1 = Operational Baseline
 → Minimal automation to support ~20 billers. Light UI/API builds. Goal: 
Operationally viable
.
Day-90+ = Optimization & Scale
 → Efficiency, self-service, advanced integrations. Goal: 
Reduce manual work & scale growth
.
Color Codes in Cells
🔴 
Net-New Dev (High Effort)
 – API, service, or UI build.
🟡 
Partial Dev (Medium Effort)
 – CRM config, vendor API, workflow extension.
🟢 
Ops/Policy (Low Effort)
 – Manual workaround or process only.
Open Qs / Decisions / Blockers
 → Tracks unresolved items, dependencies, and next steps.
Estimation
Effort (S/M/L/XL)
 = raw build/test work.
Complexity (Low/Med/High)
 = cross-team, integration, vendor/Chase risk.
RD notes: Are there any reports that billers will lose access (on Chase) after becoming a payfac

Open Questions / Blockers
CIS-Aware Funding Reports
Reports tying funding eligibility to CIS delivery (Undownloaded/Unverified, Batch Deposit). 
Decision
: 
no funding unless sent to CIS
. 
Cross-ref:
 CIS gating logic is owned in 
Thread 3 (Funding)
; this rock delivers reporting layer.
🔴 Manual CIS-aware reports for pilots (Ops validates payouts vs CIS flags).
🔴 Automate daily generation across cohorts. Exception queue for CIS failures.
🔴 Real-time CIS visibility & predictive alerts.
Needs biller comms clarity.
Ops & Finance Dashboards
Dashboards reconciling payouts vs txns vs CIS status. 
Cross-ref:
 Feeds from 
Thread 2 ingestion
 + 
Thread 3 orchestrator outputs
. Risk alerts from 
Thread 4
 may later be included.
🟢 Ops uses manual CSVs/Excel from settlement + CIS data.
🟡 Basic dashboards: NACHA ↔ CIS sent ↔ deposits ↔ txn sets.
🔴 Advanced dashboards: predictive reconciliation, drill-downs by biller/geo.
Exception & Dispute Reports
Visibility into txns not funded (CIS failures, ACH rejects, disputes). 
Cross-ref:
 Exception handling logic is in 
Thread 3 (Funding)
; 
Thread 4 (Risk)
 covers dispute/chargeback monitoring. This rock is Finance/Ops visibility layer.
🟢 Ops provides manual extracts for pilots.
🟡 Automated exception reports for Ops + Finance.
🔴 Day-90+ = Billers see exceptions in portal.
Decision:
 Which team owns distribution of exception reports?
Pricing Flags → Billing
Carry pricing flags (payer vs biller vs mixed) into billing engine. 
Cross-ref:
 Flags captured in 
Thread 1 onboarding
 and applied in 
Thread 2 processing
; this rock ensures billing system consumes them.
🔴 MVP = Basic flag capture in CRM; 
manual adjustments in billing for pilots.
🟡 Flags flow into billing engine; invoices generated consistently.
🔴 Advanced pricing matrices (e.g., premium fees for fast funding).
Biller-Facing Portal Reporting
Provide billers visibility into funding + CIS status. 
Cross-ref:
 Data source = 
Thread 3 funding outputs
; future scope may include risk signals from 
Thread 4
.
— Ops provides manual CSV extracts for pilots.
🟡 Portal access: Batch Deposit, CIS status.
🔴 Full drill-downs: txn vs funded vs reserves vs disputes.
Evidence & Audit Trail (Billing)
Store compliance artifacts tied to billing (who paid fees, what reports were generated, CIS linkage). 
Cross-ref:
 Global evidence logging is in 
Thread 4 (Risk)
; this is billing-specific evidence capture.
🟢 Manual evidence capture (Ops logs, CRM notes).
🟡 Evidence tied into report generation process.
🔴 Automated billing audit trail + retention.
Blocker:
 Define whether Finance or Compliance owns billing audit logs.
