How to access the CustomerMLS page locally
760
Change the hardcoded biller ID 145 in both Customer.aspx.vb and CustomerMLS.aspx.vb to your biller shard #
Load up ICRedirect repo, build it, and run it
Then, you’ll see “Invalid Biller” message on the local host page…
From here, run the custom console app locally to call ICRedirect and generate a link
Grab everything from the ? onwards in the generated link
Set a breakpoint at line 255 in CSRRedirecdt.aspx.vb
Paste into the URL of the loaded ICRedirect page …CSRRedirect/CSRRedirect.aspx?
This is when we step through the breakpoint in the ICRedirect repo on the CSRRedirect.aspx.vb page (line 255)
Copy the URL generated on line 255 (everything after portal/)
R_URL = "
http://localhost:55298/portal/Customer.aspx?refresh=0&BillerReference=123&InvoiceGUID=154894cc-2830-4551-995b-06ecb5a9cbbf&BG=159c0d97-bfc1-4a61-ac53-46ef08362a34
"
Now open MyIIS and build it etc.
Paste the copied URL from the breakpoint previously (everything after (portal/))
Continue past the NullReferenceException for the BillerID
