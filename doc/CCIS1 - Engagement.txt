Overview


This is the project setup and preparation, scope analysis, statement of work, and kickoff phase. The team will prepare for the project by provisioning it in Smartsheet, reviewing project requirements and notes in Salesforce, meeting with the software vendor and Biller, and setting an initial go-live date. A statement of work will then be prepared, presented to the Biller, and signed before the kickoff meeting.
