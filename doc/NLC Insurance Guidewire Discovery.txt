How many active policies currently processed in the legacy system ?
<Discovery 02/05/2025>
~ 1000 policies in SDS (legacy system) for commercial only.
InvoiceType - 165
SDS policy number sample – There is no standard policy number representation for SDS. Any policy number that doesn’t fall under step 1.a can be treated as SDS policy number Guidewire policy numbers - 10 digit alpha numeric with 9
th
 digit representing the product code with the exception of BOP -  For eg., 26000100H0 – Homeowners,  26000100A0 – PersonalAuto, 26000100D0 – DwellingFire, 26000100P0 – Personal Umbrella, BP00000100 – Businessowners (The first 2 letters represents BOP Policy)   
How many active policies currently processed in GW ? 
<Discovery 02/05/2025>
Remaining lines of business are all in Guidewire except the 1000 ( convert on renewal to new business policies) in SDS.
Are you doing "convert on renewal" and till what time are you performing this process,  And when is this legacy system rolling off?
<Discovery 02/05/2025>
Convert on renewal as New Business policies. New policy numbers are generated in GW, this will enable direct billing from GW without correlation to the legacy policy numbers.
Are they any LOBs ( Personal - Auto, Personal - Home, Commercial, Small business) still exclusively run on the legacy system ?
<Discovery 02/05/2025>
Commercial LOB is in SDS only. 
What is the expectation for the NLC legacy policies will you code to the GW BC OOBT accelerator - Invoice or Billing data,  Bill Presentment , Real Time on balances, Data pump -  Payment, 
autopay, paperless, pay-by-text
, void, refunds, reject, chargeback? 
<Discovery 02/05/2025>
NLC will use the OOBT BIF format for SDS system policies
GW will use the OOBT v10 Accelerator BIF format for all current policies.
Data Pump - 
Payments, Voids, Refund, Reject, Chargeback
Autopay enrollment, Paperless enrollment status updates
Pay-By-text updates
Does your agent still write business in the legacy system  or only on GW ?
<Discovery 02/05/2025>
Agents continue to take payments on the SDS system via Payment processor hosted portal - Next meeting planning on a demo from NLC team 
Does your agent / call center - CSRs help your insured make payments in the legacy system or only on GW ?
<Discovery 02/05/2025>
Current processor has a portal 
Can your policy holders still pay online via GW and legacy are there different portals ? 
<Discovery 02/05/2025>
No different portal
What kind of portals do you have on the legacy system to serve the policy holders?
<Discovery 02/05/2025>
Current processor has a portal where Insured and Agents are enabled to make payments. This would be a solution IC needs to present for the current implementation of NLC ( SSO connect)

Considerations
 Internal Notes
   
Response/Decision Date
How are quote payments captured?  Is the billing account number or policy number known at this time?  If yes, consider creating the account before a BIF arrives or creating one on the fly.  If no, consider using the Customer Renewal function later to move the Quote Number over to the actual billing/policy number.
 
  
<Discovery 2 - 02/05/2025>
GW PolicyCenter
Agent payments - do the agents need to act on the behalf of the policyholder for payments?  If yes, consider using Agent Connect with LoginGUID
 
 
<Discovery 2 - 02/05/2025>
Yes
Agency payments - do the agency pay with their own agency payment method?  If yes, consider using Agent Connect with a LoginGUID and user role of Account Oversight or Group Oversight.  In order to prevent long lists of linked accounts, it is recommended to link the account to the user and unlink after the transaction is complete.
 
 
<Discovery 2 - 02/05/2025>
Yes
How are renewals handled - will the billing system call our Customer Renewal API? (i.e., does the policy/account number change every policy term? If so, call the API)
 
 
<Discovery 2 - 02/05/2025>
No
Is multi-user required?  Are the additional users co-owners (LoginType 5), or Oversight (LoginTypes 3&4).  For Plan Administration, consider LoginType 4 - Group Oversight - as well as how Option 122 should be configured.  Group Oversight should stay registered even if the policyholder is unregistered.
 
 
<Discovery 2 - 02/05/2025>
No
