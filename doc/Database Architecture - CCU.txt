Context
Current architecture uses system/master database assets and a per biller database assets.  Assets are mixed in a shared model for all systems.
Decision
Create multi-tenant biller DB assets dedicated to the service.
Consequences
The DB assets get created once for the application service and only records for billers who use the service are created managed by the CRM.  There will be replication/syncing of system data to the dedicated DB assets.  Changes to the system are isolated to the application service and CRM.
Data Storage Proposals (Conceptual)
Use existing biller DB database structure
