The funding system is comprised of a API, several scheduled jobs, and event-driven jobs.
Invoice Cloud will use the Gateway Bach Close Subscriber job to fund payments processed on the Gateway
Braintree payments will disburse from Hyperwallet
OBD payments will disburse from CASS
PSN will call the Funding API directly to control when and / what funds to disburse from Hyperwallet.
Hyperwallet and CASS will be adapted to funding processors.  Funding processors process funding instructions, import account deposit information, import funding activity.
