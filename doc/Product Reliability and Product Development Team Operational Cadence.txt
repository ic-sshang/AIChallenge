Product Reliability will start working on the EBPP board for both the SRE Project and Product Toil
The EBPP item will have the respective scrum team and the work item category will be set to SRE.
SRE will work with the Product manager to add an item to the sprint as part of the planning.
SRE will work with the Development manager and Product manager on the tech lead and testing capacity (story points) that can be made available every sprint.
SRE will work on a capacity plan to compute the story points it can take up based on the TL and Testing capacity guaranteed.
SRE will at some point upgrade itself to operate like Build Breakers since the NFR change should be internally reviewed and pushed to production.
