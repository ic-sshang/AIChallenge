Overall goal is to create a form that can enhance efficiency and populate all fields required.
we need to clarify and possibly update fields to acquire the missing information that we would need to transition the ticket for approval (what kind of access to do you need? etc).
Add a free from response field of 120 characters that requires the requestor to write in their own words of what needs to be done. This field can then be used as the Title of the request as well.
Possible Workflow:
Issue type
avd
groups
prod app server
Request Type
Access
Troubleshoot
Request a change
Form Creation Notes
We have been selecting an issue type, then diving into details about your request. Let’s flip that paradigm.
First, let us know what system is giving you trouble. This should be where you're seeing a problem, not where you think the problem might be 
Following service selection, we can have tailored options for our services, each of which maps to one of the same 3 issue types we use today, albeit as request types rather than issue types. We can also request more details around specific options and make them required by form.
Example Form Creation Process

    required details:

      - What project? 
      - What resource(s) in that project? [repositories, pipelines, variable groups...] 
      - What level of access is needed? 
  - question: Is there a pipeline that isn't working the way you think it should? i.e. you're getting errors, unit test results aren't reported, etc. 
  - question: Do you have a legacy application that either doesn't have a pipeline or has an outdated pipeline that should be updated? 
  - question: Do you have something new you'd like to see happen in one of your teams pipelines? 
    issue type: change 
    required details: 
      - What's the new thing that should be implemented? 
      - Why should it be implemented? 
      - Is this needed by a specific date? Which one, and why? 
      - Provide the link to one pipeline that would use this change Kubernetes: 
  - question: Do you or your team need access to something that you don't currently have? 
  - question: Is there a cron job that isn't working the way you think it should? 
  - question: Is there a web app that isn't working the way you think it should?
