This document outlines the high-level priorities—or 
"big rocks"
—for implementing a PayFac solution integrated with the Chase Commerce Platform. The initiative targets key business outcomes: faster onboarding, streamlined reconciliation, tokenization, and account validation. Each big rock incorporates tailored Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) to ensure a robust system. Prioritization and sequencing will be determined collaboratively with stakeholders based on business needs and technical dependencies.
"Big rocks" are strategic, overarching themes critical to the success of the PayFac implementation. They are not granular tasks but high-level focus areas that will be decomposed into actionable work items for the architecture and engineering teams.

Strategic Big Rocks
1. Integration with Chase Commerce Platform
Serves as the core of the PayFac system, enabling payment processing, screening, reporting, and onboarding via Chase’s APIs.
Architecture Team
:  
Define technical specs for the 
IC Chase Screening API
, including rate limits, error handling, retry policies, and integration with its own datastore to store screening profiles.  
Research integration with the 
Chase Commerce Platform Screening API
, determining data flow and how to enforce/validate screening calls (e.g., embedding screening values like submerchant descriptors in payment auth).  
Define tech specs for the 
IC Chase Payment Processing API
, to pull data from the CTP, convert it into Chase-compatible requests, and embed screening data where required.  
Research integration with the 
Chase Commerce Platform Direct Payments API
, mapping CTP data flows for credit card and ACH payments.  
Investigate 
Chase Onboarding API
 specs to support the onboarding wizard.  {if this is a need}
Research, design, and define a 
tokenization approach
 to ensure secure, scalable implementation, integrating with payment processing workflows.  
Prototype 
tokenization and account validation
 components for security and scalability testing, ensuring PCI compliance. {account validation can be a potential phase 2}
Engineering Team
:  
Develop the 
IC Chase Screening API
 with resiliency, integrating with the Chase Commerce Platform Screening API.  
Develop the 
IC Chase Payment Processing API
 with retry/timeout mechanisms and avoiding direct CTP integration due to its brittleness.  
Implement integration with the 
Chase Commerce Platform Reporting API
 using scalable, paginated queries for transaction details and balances.  
Create the 
IC Chase Onboarding API
 to support the onboarding wizard.  {Is the wizard still on the table?}
Integrate 
tokenization and account validation
 with secure, PCI-compliant storage, linking to the IC Chase Payment Processing API. 
Key NFRs
:  
Resilience
: Gracefully handle API failures.  
Scalability
: Support high transaction volumes.  
Security
: Safeguard sensitive payment data.
2. Funding and Settlement
Ensures flexible and efficient payment settlement across payment types (credit card, ACH, OBD), supporting the funding engine for payment processing and streamlined reconciliation.
Architecture Team
:  
Design the funding engine leveraging Biller shards as the source of truth for payment data.  
Finalize the NACHA file generation strategy (single consolidated file vs. individual files per biller), ensuring idempotent file creation, and define descriptors and biller identification in files.  
Define integration with 
JP Morgan Treasury Services
, including retry logic for fault tolerance and FTP delivery specs.  
Research integration with the 
Chase Commerce Platform Reporting API
 for funding-related data (e.g., ACKs, rejects, payback, TSR wire).  
Plan ACH processing workflows outside the Chase Commerce Platform, including debit logic using owned bank accounts for resilience.
Engineering Team
:  
Build per-biller funding jobs (Biller Funding Job) to pull data from Biller shards, calculate funding, and send instructions to the 
IC Chase Funding API
, with idempotent retries.  
Develop the 
IC Chase Funding API
 with scalable storage, duplicate detection, and hold/stop functionality for risk management.  
Implement the 
IC Chase Funding Job
 to aggregate instructions, generate NACHA files (per finalized strategy), and deliver to JP Morgan Treasury Services with failover mechanisms.  
Add ACH debit logic to funding jobs, resilient to timeouts/disruptions, using owned bank accounts for external ACH processing.
Key NFRs
:  
Idempotency
: Prevent duplicate transactions.  
Fault Tolerance
: Maintain reliable processing during disruptions.  
Scalability
: Handle peak processing demands efficiently.
3. Risk Management and Compliance
Reduces financial risk and ensures adherence to regulatory standards, including robust reject handling and real-time risk assessment.
Architecture Team
:  
Define 
reject handling processes
, including notification timelines, funding strategies (e.g., fund before/after receiving funds), and biller bank account configurations (e.g., dual accounts for deposits/withdrawals).  
Design 
funding instruction flagging/holding logic
 for real-time risk assessment (e.g., stopping funding if underwater accounts).  
Explore scalable configurations for managing biller bank accounts, ensuring reject handling preserves data integrity.  
Compile compliance requirements (e.g., PCI DSS) with immutable audit logs for Chase API interactions.
Engineering Team
:  
Implement 
reject processing
 within funding jobs, storing rejects in Biller ahards with transactional consistency and triggering funding adjustments (e.g., pulling money back from billers).  
Build 
hold/stop functionality
 in the IC Chase Funding API to manage high-risk instructions.  
Develop scalable, tamper-proof 
audit logging mechanisms
 for all Chase API calls and funding decisions.
Key NFRs
:  
Auditability
: Maintain comprehensive, tamper-proof logs.  
Data Integrity
: Ensure consistent, accurate data across systems.  
Resilience
: Enable real-time risk assessments and responses.
4. Customer Experience
Enhances onboarding and reconciliation, driving biller satisfaction and adoption through a faster onboarding wizard and simplified reporting system.
Architecture Team
:  
Design the 
onboarding wizard workflow
 integrated with the Chase Onboarding API to handle sign-ups (confirm product vision with stakeholders).  
Design 
KYC and external screening integrations
, reviewing PSN’s current setup for alignment with PayFac needs.  
Define system requirements for a 
biller reporting system
, supporting low-latency retrieval from Biller shards and Chase files, including reconciliation for multi-source deposits.  
Plan 
UI/UX designs
 for onboarding and reporting, scalable for concurrent users.
Engineering Team
:  
Build the customer-facing 
onboarding wizard
 with real-time calls to the IC Chase Onboarding API and robust retry mechanisms.  
Develop the 
biller reporting system
 using optimized, scalable queries for reconciliation across payment types (credit card, ACH, OBD).  
Implement 
reconciliation logic
 for multi-source deposits with fault tolerance to ensure data consistency.
Key NFRs
:  
Low Latency
: Deliver fast reporting and real-time interactions.  
High Availability
: Ensure uptime during peak usage.  
Scalability
: Support growing user base.
5. Biller Migrations 
Once enough functionality is available through the new PayFac model to support a subset of billers, we will need to migrate billers in an efficient and thoughtful manner.
