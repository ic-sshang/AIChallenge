Post-Provisioning
Since Dotnet Framework 4.8 comes preinstalled on newer Windows Servers, we shouldn’t need to install it ourselves. We may need to update it, though.
Turns out it’s hard to find 
all
 installed versions of Dotnet Framework. I could only find commands to get the 
latest
 version. This should be fine, as Runtime 4.8 should support running apps built for 4.6.2 or other previous 4+ versions
Dotnet Framework 4.8 actually comes pre-installed on Server 2022! Haven’t checked 2025, but I’d imagine it’s the same. We may not need to do anything here.

All commands I’ve tried only show 4.8!
Finding earlier versions (pre-4.5) is actually easier. Some servers had older versions, i.e. 4.0, 3.5, 3.0, and even 2.0 installed. We 
cannot 
have anything that outdated on our servers - 4.5 went EOL over 10 years ago.
