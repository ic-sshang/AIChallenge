Rules of Engagement

Import/Setup UB Bill ‘Form Definition’
Biller 
Project Assignment
‘Form Definition’ is attached in case you need to send to Biller: 
Ensure all Caselle biller workstations have latest general release version of Caselle Connect Version 2022.02 or later.
Biller Task
Project Assignment
If the biller does not have the proper Caselle version, the integration features will not work properly. This includes ACH rejects, AutoPay change log and user registration email.
Ensure server where Connect Online Web Service (COWS) is running. If COWS has not been updated since the last general release update, COWS will need to be updated immediately on the customers Caselle server.
Biller Task
Project Assignment
If COWS is not running, IC cannot connect to the billers endpoint.
Ensure Biller has Security Licenses in place
Biller Task
Project Assignment
Verify that the customer has the CRW40000 Security License (Cash Receipting Web Service Interface)
Verify that the customer has the UMW4000 Security License (Utility Management Web Service Interface)
If customer does not have the licenses list above: Have the customer contact their Caselle CRM to get the license added to their security file. This could take a couple of days depending on when the request is submitted.
Security Licenses are needed in order for the integration to work real time. Workspace needs to allow payments online payments in order for payments to post.
THIS IS OFTEN MISSED.  IM NEEDS TO MAKE SURE THIS IS SET DURING PROJECT ASSIGNMENT
Verify that COWS is installed and running on the Caselle server
Biller Task
Project Assignment
It is also important to make sure that an admin at the city has access to the Caselle server where COWS is running on so if there is ever a problem the user can login to the server, verify COWS is running and restart if necessary.
Make sure the Cash Receipting Workspace that is setup specifically for Online Payments has the checkbox marked to “use for online payments”.
Biller Task
Project Assignment
If this is not selected, payments will error out in the data pump (with a very generic error message that’s difficult to decipher)
