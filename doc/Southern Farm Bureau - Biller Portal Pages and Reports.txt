The following is a list of the biller portal pages and reports, which are color coded based on their ability to display information specific to specific Invoice Types. Some are already designed to filter content this way, so that work shouldn’t be too difficult. Others such as the Search Customers report are showing information at the customer level, which adds some complexity.
Which of the red ones will SFB need to be available AND effectively isolate the data to specific Invoice Types? For each, what strategy should be used for displaying accurate information without exposing customers, payments, or invoices associated with invoice types that the user isn’t authorized to view?
