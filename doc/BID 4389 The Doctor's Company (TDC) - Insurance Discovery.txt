CSR/Agent Experience
General
Internal Notes
  
Response/Decision
How do CSRs/Agents access and use the system today?
Can you please perform a demo of this experience?
How will this functionality be done on Invoice Cloud:  (Biller Portal, AgentConnect, CPV2)?
Agents (representatives) can take one-time premium payments, assist with Autopay setup, and store payment methods using Duck Creek or Nova. Additional Invoice Cloud features discussed include Scheduling Payments and Pay By Text.
When entering a payment, the total outstanding balance (full policy) and current amount due (premium) can be paid. "Pay Other Amount" is displayed; however, it requires approval.
Can CSRs/Agents process payments by using a customer's stored payment method?
If the store payment does not exist, can CSRs/Agents create new stored payment methods?
One-time Payment URL from AgentConnect does not show stored payments unless you are using CPV2 with Auth Token. 
Store payment methods are displayed within AgentConnect for an Owner. If payment methods are stored by other members (such as Guests or Group Administrators), a LoginGUID specific to that member can be used to access their stored payment information. By default, the Owner's payment methods are displayed when using our AgentConnect solution.
If the store payment does not exist, can CSRs/Agents create new stored payment methods?
Yes.  Current system allows an agent to add store payment methods.
Do CSRs/Agents assist customers with self service activities like Paperless / Autopay / Pay by Text? If so, please explain:
 Current Options:
Pay Now
Enroll AutoPay
Manage Payment Methods
Currently, there are options for Make a Payment, AutoPay, and Saved Payment methods. A discussion about adding additional options, such as Pay by Text and Scheduling Payments, was held and will be reviewed. Paperless can only be set up by the member, not an Agent.
Do some CSRs/Agents need different permissions than others? (please explain)
 
Yes, this is controlled by Duck Creek using permission roles. For example, not all agents can access AutoPay, and this will continue to be controlled by TDC with permission roles.
Do CSRs/Agents accept payments at the counter (in-person)? 
 
N/A
IF YES:
Review options in biller portal/agent connect/Cloud Pay V2
N/A 
Do you use a separate system/software for counter payments and if so what software? 
 
 N/A
When accepting credit card payments, is a card reader used?  EMV or Swipe?
 
 N/A
Do agents need to act on the behalf of the policyholder for taking payments? 
Yes
Does the agency pay with their own agency payment method (using the Agents bank to pay a policy of an insured customer)? 
If yes, consider using Agent Connect with a LoginGUID and user role of Account Oversight or Group Oversight.  
Remote Authentication API must be used to register the agency in a specified user role.
In order to prevent long lists of linked accounts (register), it is recommended to link the account to the user and unlink (unregister) after the transaction is complete.  
No
Additional Notes
Invoice Cloud AgentConnect product will be utilized for this experience.  Additional Developer Guides will be provided.
 
Member/ Insured Experience
General Questions
 Internal Notes
  
Response/Decision
How do your members make payments today and how do they access the system?
Can you please perform a demo of this experience?    
Members access the TDC website (
http://thedoctors.com
 ) and click Sign In.
Members can enter premium payments, set up AutoPay, and store payment methods. Additional Invoice Cloud features, such as Scheduling Payments and Pay by Text, were discussed.
When entering a payment, only the total policy amount or premium can be paid—no partial payments are allowed
Do You have Single Sign On capabilities or will you be using Invoice Cloud Customer Portal? 
 
TBD
If SSO, do you have a Identity Provider for SAML SSO or will you be using SSOConnect?
Azure AD – SAML or Cloud SSO Connect.
For members wanting to make a payment without logging into the member portal, a guest payment link can be provided for either (A) the Invoice Cloud virtual site, or (B) utilizing the Invoice Cloud “one-time” payment link via Cloud Pay v2 available within an iframe experience. Please keep in mind that a valid account number must be passed within the API request; therefore, there must be a lookup feature for a member to validate their account number prior to executing the API request.
Is multi-user needed? Ability for more than one member to access the same policy? 
Are the additional users co-owners (LoginType 5), or Oversight (LoginTypes 3&4).  For Plan Administration, consider LoginType 4 - Group Oversight - as well as how Option 122 should be configured.  Group Oversight should stay registered even if the policyholder is unregistered.  The Remote Authentication can be used to register these accounts.
Yes
What part of the user experience will be through your UI and what part of the User experience will be through Invoice Cloud?
 
N/A
How will existing users be migrated for paperless and autopay?
 
 TBD
Do you need to link accounts?  
This feature is needed if a policy holder has more than one policy, or an agency needs to access numerous policies grouped together at Invoice Cloud.
 
 Multiple accounts for one user
Yes, documentation on how to link accounts is included within the SAML and SSO Connect documentation. 
This feature is needed if a policy holder has more than one policy/account, or an agency needs to access numerous policies/accounts grouped together at Invoice Cloud
Do you need IVR payments? 
     If so, what is the unique identifier your customers would use?
 
 Policy Number number which will be populated in DisplayAccountNumber will be used as the primary key for the IVR.
Types of Coverage
a.      Tail Coverage
b.      Retention Billing
c.      Insurance Premium
Do you want to offer Pay By Text, Scheduling Payments? 
 Current Options:
Pay Now
Enroll AutoPay
Manage Payment Methods
 Yes, these options will be offered.
Additional Notes
 A determination on whether to use SAML SSO Connect or SSO Connect is being discussed internally at TDC along with Duck Creek. Documentation for both products will be sent for review. Further discussions will be needed after the review.
Invoices
Invoice Types
Internal Notes
Response/Decision
Invoice Type/Business Type
What are the different invoice types that are generated for policy holders?   Do these differ from each other?  i.e., cancellation notice, premium invoices, collection invoices?
Examples:  Premium (monthly/quarterly policy payment), Membership (some insurance companies require a membership fee to get a policy with them - charged annually).  
Do all invoices get paid to the same bank account? No.  Separate invoice types will be created at Invoice Cloud to determine the bank account setup.
i.     The Doctors Company (TDC) –InvoiceTypeID:  164
ii.     Risk Retention Group (RRG) – InvoiceTypeID:  165
iii.     Hospitals Insurance Company (HIC) – InvoiceTypeID: 166
iv.     DOCPAC (Does not need a separate InvoiceTypeID within BIF).
If Multiple types, can services be billed separately?
Do customers receive one invoice with multiple policies or separate invoices?  If not on the same invoice, separate invoice types are needed

How are changes made to an existing bill?  Is there a separate file for updates to an existing bill?
For example, need to modify due date, notification dates, auto-pay date, etc.
How can IC tell if it is a new invoice Vs a change to an existing invoice.
Based on the fields that need to be updated, this might require a BIF or IUF.

Are you able to customize data sent in the files?
If a change is needed to a custom file, can this be done?
N/A
Tell us about how your quote system “Offer of Insurance” works and the issuance process of quotes/policies
Direct to Consumer
 – Initiated by customer or external agent and paid by customer.
a.      Initial Policy Note (Offer of Insurance) needs the ability to generate an invoice “on-the-fly” so payment can be taken. Not all IPNs will make a payment on the same day.
Invoice Cloud product Cloud Pay v2 API can be used to generate the invoice and facilitate payment. Any invoice that is created on-the-fly does not need to be included in the BIF.
Generating IPN (Standard process)
 – A determination was not made if these IPNs need to be generated “on-the-fly” or if including them in the BIF will be sufficient. The only reason to create it immediately would be to make payment. TDC/Duck Creek will review their workflows and determine if this is needed. In the event an “on-the-fly” invoice is needed, Invoice Cloud product AgentConnect will be used.
Tell us about how you handle your cancellation and rewrite process? Does a new Policy/Account/Invoice gets created for the insured? 
Tell us about how you handle your cancellation and rewrite process.
Does a new Policy/Account/Invoice get created for the insured?
Cancellation – The IPN changes to "Inforce" when any payment is made. If no payment is made on the IPN within 10 days, the offer will be withdrawn.
To remove the invoice from Invoice Cloud, consider using 'Deactivate' in the BIF file. Alternatively, you can use the PaymentExpirationDate field within the BIF for IPN records. This date can be set for X days from the current day, and when that date occurs, it will be the last day a payment can be made on Invoice Cloud. . The invoice will still be visible; however, it will display a message indicating that payment cannot be made.  An optional PaymentExpirationMessage can be displayed if included within the BIF.
a.      Canceled for non-payment – Same amount if due for first cancellation notice, invoice number will not change.  If the policy cancels for no payment, the policy can be reinstated.  
How are quote payments captured?  Is the billing account number or policy number known at this time? 
If yes, consider creating the account before a BIF arrives or creating one on the fly.  If no, consider using the Customer Renewal function later to move the Quote Number over to the actual billing/policy number.
Policy Number is available before payment is taken. No payment is taken on a quote number. Policy Number and Account Number can be the same.
How are renewals handled? (i.e., does the policy/account number change every policy term? 
If the policy/account number changes at renewal, call Invoice Cloud Customer Renewal API?
If a policy term is transferred or restarted (reissue) to a new account number, the renewal API can be used to transfer a members autopay setting and link the new account.
Invoice Functionality
Internal Notes
Response/Decision
Does your system produce unique invoice numbers?
If yes, are these numbers printed on bills, would customers recognize these numbers? If no, what combination of values can we use to create a unique number per invoice?
Yes
How are balances calculated per invoice? (Explain Balance Forward and Open Billing)
total balance on most recent invoice or balance available on multiple invoices
Prior amount is balanced forward in most cases.  If the balance should not always be forwarded, there is a field in the BIF that can be set to determine if balance forward should be applied.
Are fees (late fees, penalties, interest, etc.) added to the invoice or the account?
Separate invoice for fees (NSF) and if not paid it will roll into next billing cycle.
Do you have a field for Past Due balances?
Yes, Prior Balance.
During the discussion of creating the BIF, it was suggested that the prior balance be included in the current balance due field and not use the Prior Balance (PastDue) field.
Autopay will only collect on the value passed in for the Current Balance Due.  The Prior Balance would require a member to access the system to pay this amount.
Are there any Duplicate invoices?
     If yes, which bill should IC import?
N/A
Is there a minimum required payment amount different than the current monthly balance?
This is typically the balance due and not used in Insurance.
Minimum amount = Balance Due + Past Due.  Payment Amount must be => balance due.
Can an insured pay the balance due or the total amount due (full policy)? Can payments be made between the balance due and the total amount due? 
Pay Other Amount is not allowed for Members and requires approval for internal associates.
Account/Policy Numbers
Internal Notes
Response/Decision
Are Account/Policy Numbers unique per person? (Do you have customer numbers?)
Yes
How is billing handled? Policy Based, Account Based or Both? 
This is used to decide on what the IC unique identifier/account number will be.  If Policy based,  we typically use the Policy as the account number.
Both
Under what circumstances would Account Numbers change?
Account numbers might change if they are renewed.  If its the same person we suggest linking accounts or using customer renewal API.
If a policy term is transferred or restarted (reissue) to a new account number, the renewal API can be used to transfer a members autopay setting and link the new account.
Do you expire previous bills so that payments cannot be made after a certain time? In what scenario(s)?
IPN and ERP invoices in some cases cannot take payment after a certain amount of time.  This can be accomplished by setting a paymentExpirtationDate in the BIF file to indicate the last day a payment can be made, or by updating the invoice balance to 0.00 when using RTDR.   Optionally, the PaymentExpirationDate/Message can be sent through RTDR.  This needs further discovery at TDC to review current workflows.
Do you have any functionality today to block a customer from paying by payment type ACH or CC?
This item is still under research in regard to blocking CC signup in AutoPay.
Since HIC invoices never except CC, please include in the BIF 356 – BlockPaymentsCC = 1.  This will ensure that CC will always be blocked for guest and registered payments.
File Transfer
Internal Notes
Response/Decision
Is there an automated process to produce the file? 
Files should be sent to IC any time there is a new billing

Balance Updates
Adjustments
 
Internal Notes
 
Response/Decision
What is the best way for IC to update balances? An API is preferred to allow IC to connect to your system to obtain the most recent balance.  
 
Invoice Cloud prefers using an API to connect to the external system to obtain real time balances.  This is referred to as RTDR (real time data refresh)?
 TDC will create an API for RTDR.  The developer guide was provided on 3/6/2025.
API: 
(RTDR - Real-time Data Refresh) Does the API allow balance to be pulled by invoice or by full account balance?
Account and Invoice will be used in the request.
API:
  Will the API reflect the balance including any late fees, etc.?
Yes
Files Needed
If an API cannot be provided, the following files are needed to keep balances updated.
N/A
IC Adjustment File (BAF)
Review specs
N/A
Integrator file (if not using IC BAF)
Can you customize what is produced in the file?  Can invoice number be added if not present?
Requirement:  If a bill is paid outside of Invoice Cloud and the balance is now zero, the adjustment file must include this information.
N/A
Will the file contain the adjusted balance or only the adjustments amount for each invoice?
Balance differential verses fixed adjustment
N/A
How often can Adjustments be sent?
 
Adjustment File must be sent a minimum of 1x per day

Account Changes
From Invoice Cloud
 
Description
 
Response/Decision
Invoice Cloud sends Autopay, Paperless, Customer Registrations, Pay by Text, Email Changes is there an API to allow these changes?
* email changes and customer registrations will be prohibited if using Single Sign On.
 Invoice Cloud Datapump
 TDC will be created APIs for Datapump for account changes.
If no API can be created, what format should we send these items to you? (Prompt for sample file)
 
 N/A
From CIS
 
 
Invoice Cloud updates blocking of ACH/CC (cash only) customers in real time. Can this status be included in your API balance response (RTDR)?
 
 No blocking is done by TDC with the exception of allowing customers to sign up for autopsy with a CC if they are receiving an ACH discount on their policy.  This will be controlled within the BIF.
If no, IC Customer Update File (CUF) is preferred.
 Review IC CUF Spec
N/A
If no, Billers must manually update blocked payments via biller portal

Response/Decision
Would you be able to receive an API call to your system when payments are made in Invoice Cloud (Datapump)?
Provided dev guide as TDC will create an API to be used for datapump.
Can the API also be used to send ACH Rejects/Voids/Chargebacks/Credits?
Only payments will be sent as TDC does not want these transactions datapumped.
Are there specific GL codes that must be used post payments or Rejects/Voids/Chargebacks/Credits  ?
N/A
Are additional fields available in the API to submit a reference number?
Reference number would be used to pass a Payment GUID.  The payment GUID must be validated in the event a duplicate payment is sent in error.  If a payment GUID is on file already, the second payment would be blocked (error).
N/A
Is a ReceiptGUID required?
Payment GUIDs are generated for each payment made for each invoice.  A ReceiptGUID can contain multiple payments for different invoices and are representative of a transaction.
