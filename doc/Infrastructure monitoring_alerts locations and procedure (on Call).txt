Opsgenie On Call Rotation is Based on a priority system. Any Alerts sent to Opsgenie that do not have a priority level will not route to the on call rotation.The Levels are as follows:
P1 - The highest priority and is meant for tasks that require attention at any time of the day. Typically this is reserved for a production down/critical issues. The on call tech is expected to respond to these types of request 24x7 with a 5 minute “Ack” time via Opsgenie
P2- The second highest priority and is meant for tasks that are important, but that can be handled during daytime hours. The on call tech is expected to respond to these types of request from 8am to 8pm est 7 days a week with a 5 minute “Ack” time via Opsgenie
P3-  The lowest priority and is meant for regular workday issues. The on call tech is expected to respond to these types of request from 9am to 5pm est Monday-Friday with a 5 minute “Ack” time via Opsgenie
Priority Routing Time
- The time an alert will trigger:
P1- 24x7days a week
P2- 8am-8pm est 7 days a week
P3- 9am-5pm est Monday through Friday
On Call Escalation
The current on call call schedule can be found here : 
https://invoicecloud.app.opsgenie.com/teams/dashboard/863ca81e-df90-4d1c-b4cf-50829eeba455/main
The escalation policy works as follows:
Once an alert is triggered and assuming the priority routing time is correct an alert will be sent to the current on call tech (email, text, and app notification)
The on call tech will have 5 minutes to “Ack”knowledge receiving the alert in Opsgenie (app or website), then begin working on the issue.
If the on call tech fails to “Ack” in the 5 minute window, the next person in the rotation (the backup) will get the same alert and be given a 5 minute window to “Ack”knowledge receiving the alert in Opsgenie (app or website), then begin working on the issue.
If the backup person fails to “Ack” in their 5 minute window, the same alert will be sent to the escalation manager schedule. The current on call manager will get the same alert and be given a 10 minute window to “Ack”knowledge receiving the alert in Opsgenie (app or website), then begin working on the issue.
If the escalation manager fails to “Ack” in their 10 minute window, the same alert will be sent to the rest of the infrastructure team. At that point any member of the team can  “Ack”knowledge receiving the alert in Opsgenie (app or website), then begin working on the issue.

A bi-weekly meeting has been setup for the infrastructure team to discuss Alert changes. During this meeting The following will be discussed:
New alerts that have been or need to be created and/or integrated with Opsgenie
