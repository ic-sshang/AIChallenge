The Problem
Why: How do we know this is a real problem and worth solving?
In order to improve performance for billers and partners; we want to build out a functionality that will allow InvoiceCloud to convert BIF files in to JSON files.
Notes from internal meeting May 2023:
Kuberneti .next 6 framework
Stratus Webservices- convert BIF to JSON
With the business logic, we need to keep it pure to understand 
Auto mapper?
New database to support JSON?
YMAL Repo?
Convert at the endport
We need some sort of storage to read from like Azura or AWS blob
ICDatabase library may be depricated
Is there database work happening with Data Services currently? 
Will we flatted and remove BIF formatting all together
