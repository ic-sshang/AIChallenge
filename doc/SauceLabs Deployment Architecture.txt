Update 10/2/2023
Security rejected SauceLabs until we can create a DMZ network area to run it, which would be protected by firewall rules. This is the proposal for the design of that DMZ.

Notes from call  18th Sept 2023
No ingress, outbound calling to establish tunnel
Network location – Tooling location – Hub
Runtime? – VM or Containers?
Should be able have baseline of IC image – CrowdStrike etc.
How to limit access to where the proxy can reach?
FW rules for inbound traffic (on outbound FW) –
Limit outbound from Proxy VM/Container/Appliance to Saucelabs backend
Limit LAN/LAN traffic between Proxy Appl to testing targets
Choice of tunnel or public IP
Allows test endpoints inside network- with tunnel
Allows public endpoints outside network – hence thru Cloudflare
What do we need to know to determine network location? (Rob Q)
Infra:
Spoke Vnet
One subnet with a route table to the fireawll
ACI
Pull a public image or ACR?
Palo Firewall
Firewall policy / Object setup for the Vnet
Allow outbound 443
maybe add an allow list outbound for extra security
Allow access to DevTest networks
Network Updates:
Copy Objects/Policy from Production Palo to Non-Production Palo
Update Peer from Central India to SBX Hub
Update route from Central India to SBX Hub
Update DevTest networks to peer to SBX Hub
Remove DevTest networks peer from PRD Hub
