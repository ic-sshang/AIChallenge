Overview
Today billers use the Biller Portal to manage schedule payments for their Payers ( payment plans etc…). 
Part of the Oracle CIS system integration requires the importing of recurring payment file(s), creating and updating TBD, for the purposes of managing scheduled payments on behalf of the biller.  
Proposal
Create an biller facing API to manage CRUD operations around the current scheduled payment database tables.  A import process will pull the files from a FTP site and process the file contents against the API, create the corresponding export response file, and upload it to the FTP site.
