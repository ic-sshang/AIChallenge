Docker is a popular platform for containerization, which is a method of packaging applications and their dependencies into isolated units called containers. These containers can run consistently across different environments, making it easier to develop, test, and deploy applications.
Here are some key points about Docker:
Isolation
: Docker containers encapsulate an application and its dependencies, ensuring that they run consistently regardless of where they are deployed.
Efficiency
: Containers are lightweight and share the host operating system's kernel, making them more efficient than traditional virtual machines.
Portability
: Docker containers can be easily moved between different environments, such as development, testing, and production, without any changes to the application.
Scalability
: Docker makes it easier to scale applications by allowing you to run multiple containers simultaneously and manage them using orchestration tools like Kubernetes.
Version Control
: Docker images can be versioned, allowing you to track changes and roll back to previous versions if needed.
