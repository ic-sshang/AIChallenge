Backlog Health
The backlog has been averaging around 18.8, which is within the normal range (15–20) for integration tickets.
MTTR (by priority)
https://invoicecloud.atlassian.net/jira/dashboards/10393?maximized=28340
Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) – August 2025
Highest Priority:
 4.2 days
High Priority:
 11 days
Medium Priority:
 13.2 days
Low Priority:
 17.2 days
In August, MTTR increased significantly across low, medium, and high priority tickets. This was primarily due to a catch-up effort on older tickets created in mid to late July, which had aged in the queue before being resolved. While a few complex tickets contributed to the overall time, the main factor was the resolution of these older items, which skewed the average upward.
Example aging tickets resolved soon after being picked up during catch-up:

Despite the overall increase, highest priority tickets continued to be resolved within a week, demonstrating that critical issues were still being prioritized effectively. By the end of the month, with additional support onboarded, we were able to reduce the backlog. As of early September, our queue is now under 15 tickets, indicating strong recovery and improved operational efficiency.

Since the beginning of the year, a total of 552 tickets have been reported in the integration space as of August 2025, highlighting various issues across different services:
Bill Presentment
 is the most frequently reported service, with 161 tickets. Of these, 
44 tickets
 are related to 
PDF Extraction
, accounting for 
27%
 of all 
Bill Presentment
 issues. This high percentage indicates that 
PDF Extraction
 is a critical area within 
Bill Presentment
 that requires attention.
About a 
quarter
 (
26%
) of all integration tickets are classified as 
additional information
, which implies that these are mostly research conducted to answer questions.
Bill Presentment
 and 
File Processing
 are the most critical areas for integrations, representing the primary sources of toil and accounting for just 
over half
 of 
all integration tickets
.
Ticket Volume Analysis

In August, a total of 58 integration-related tickets were resolved. Of these, 15 were specifically related to bill presentment, and 12 to file processing; that would account for 26% and 21% of tickets respectively. This adds to a total of 47%. However, the biggest contributor to tickets was data pump at a 29%. It seems that we had more improvement and new feature request for data pump than usual. Most of the work for this month could be classified as research and data update given the mitigation actions of additional information, database updates, and solutions architecture. Only 3% of tickets were actual defects in our code, and 16% were request for code changes. This is a significant decrease in bug, but and increase in modifications This data indicates that most of the team's time was spent conducting code analysis to help CS navigate integrations for biller’s/SP.

Next Steps
Once the PDF Bursting Tool is complete, we will begin discovery for the 
self-serviceable tools
.
Here's some context from a previous presentation:
Problem
:
PDF linking has become a bottleneck, consuming time and computing resources. These tickets often require manual intervention from Dev Support (DS), slowing resolution and diverting focus from higher-impact work.
Solution Strategy
:
We're developing tools to streamline PDF-related processes and reduce DS ticket volume by shifting ownership to CS and eventually to billers.
Bursting Tool
: Splits large PDFs into smaller, manageable segments.
Self-Service tools:
 A collection of comprehensive tool to handle all PDF-related needs for billers, enabling CS to manage requests independently.
Long-Term Goal
:
Shift PDF-related responsibilities from DS → CS → billers to:
Reduce ticket volume
Improve turnaround times
Free up DS for more complex engineering tasks
Action Items
Finalize and release the PDF Bursting Tool.
Continue research into self-service tools and AI opportunities.
Review new file processing tool in the CRM
Project Discovery (For 2026):
Explore self-serviceable. (SR-ITEM)
Explore potential automation to track repeat tickets. (SR-ITEM) Account for repeat tickets and measure ticket uniqueness.
Explore ML validation, predict bad files/pdfs [SR-ITEM] .
