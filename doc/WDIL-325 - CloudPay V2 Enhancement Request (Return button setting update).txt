Original Request:
The Doctors Company is using CPV2 for their consumer portal which is where a new customer can go to get a quote for a new policy and then make a payment to bind the policy. They want to be able to redirect the new customer to their website to register/setup their account once they have made a payment using the 'Go To Homepage' button (see attached screenshot). 
They can change the URL this button is pointed to, but they cannot change the verbiage on the button (they want it to say 'Set Up Your Account' instead of 'Go To Homepage'). 
Can we make a change that will enable the biller to change the verbiage on this button? It would need to work for iframes and redirects.
Requesting Biller: The Doctors Management Company (

Findings: 
           Implementing this change wouldn’t be a huge lift, but would require multiple minor changes in the CRM and MyIIS, and a good amount of testing (
and automation potentially
). We would need to add a new setting, flag or option in the CRM to update the 'Go to Homepage' text in the screenshot below, and we would need to update multiple confirmation pages. Currently, we support passing a 
ReturnUrl
 in the Cloud Pay v2 request.
Code Reference:
The confirmation pages that we’ll need to update on the MyIIS side:
