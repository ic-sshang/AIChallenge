Problem 
We are switching from Appcues to Pendo. Pendo is used in the biller portal and we’ve seen is a superior product compared to Appcues in terms of analytics and usability. We believe by switching products we will have same if not better guide configuration on the payer site and most importantly have advanced data collection and analysis in the Pendo application.

We are adding the Pendo snippet on all Pages on the Virtual Site and Customer Portal. On all pages we are using our visitor cookie ID as the visitor ID, and we are using the BID as the Account ID. Our cookie tracking we added on the Virtual Site and Customer portal lasts for 30 days and we can use for tracking the same user across unauthenticated sessions and authenticated. On all pages we are using Pendo’s function to obscure any open text fields. We are using this function to obscure and not collect any sensitive information. 
Implementation support from Pendo is here:

Go to “Subscriptions” then “Payer Experience” to view payer data. 
Payer data is 
NOT 
in Biller Portal.  
Data Mappings is where our  "name" and "type" of data that Pendo uses for all analyses. 
Agent Metadata that we are gathering for each session: 
Default Visitor Metadata:
First Visit
Last Visit
Number of Days Active
Number of Events
Time on Site
Most recent browser version and name
Most recent operating system
Most recent server name
Default Account Metadata:
First Visit
Last Visit
Number of Days Active
Number of Events
Number of Visitors
Time on Site
Key Features / Feature Abilities
Visitor ID and Account ID are always our generated cookies and BID respectively. 
Identifying first time payer we can only do so from a new cookie being generate. 
Funnels and Paths. Paths will help us explore how and percent of users who reach a certain page.. Funnels will be built within a Pendo dashboard.
Virtual Site and Customer Portal → One time Payment
Virtual Site and Customer Portal → sign up for autopay 
Virtual Site and Customer Portal → sign up for paperless
Virtual Site → Registration 
Virtual Site → Login
Segmentation. Segmentations we will want to create for all analytics: 
unauthenticated (virtual site)
authenticated (customer portal)
regional, vertical
device
Tagging Features and Track Events. We will be manually tagging features in Pendo, using Tagging Feature. This will be our first step in tagging features/click events. From what we find here we can then determine if we need to add Tracking Events. 
A/B testing. We can do A/B testing through segmentation of “Sample Group” values set by even/odd numbers. 
Guide Management. Questions from working with Appcues we need to consider: 
Guide Hierarchy. This is similar to Appcues. 
Triggering a guide. 
on page load - yes 
on page load only once 
on hover? 
on customized click area
trigger guide based on Meta Data - and changing Meta data - yes. 
Later we may want Salesforce Metadata to be sent included as well. We would consider adding…..
Exporting Data 
Exporting Data from Pendo we will use: 
https://support.pendo.io/hc/en-us/articles/360032210211-Recipe-Prepare-Your-Data-for-BI-Visualization-Tools
 
This data will be added in IC Data Warehouse when applicable. Data will be exported for the July-August 2022 Sweepstakes.
