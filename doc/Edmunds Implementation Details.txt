Summary
 INVOICES THAT DO NOT HAVE A CHANGED DUE DATE WILL BE TREATED AS ADJUSTMENTS, INVOICES WITH A CHANGED DUE DATE WILL BE TREATED AS INVOICES.
Edmunds billers can add InvoiceCloud SFTP to their Collections Parameter Maintenance file transfer to automatically send us the file that we use for invoices/adjustments each day.  An SFTP will need to be created and credentials provided to the biller.  If biller does not have this option they will need to manually drop tax file daily.
