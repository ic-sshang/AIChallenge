Detailed Overview
The meeting commenced with Joel Kennedy facilitating introductions and setting the stage for the discussion on implementing single sign-on (SSO) capabilities within the organization this year. Joel emphasized the importance of building user-friendly systems that cater to the actual users, and introduced John Whitworth as the senior product manager who would lead this initiative.
Each attendee introduced themselves, providing context for their roles in relation to the upcoming SSO project. Sarah Marr, who supervises the Billing Team and uses the Invoice Cloud daily, highlighted her position as a key point of contact for non-technical issues. Anita Hamilton, the Director of Customer Experience and Engagement, echoed the importance of user feedback. Robert Waltney and Chris Campbell, leads of the IT security and infrastructure teams, respectively, outlined the organization’s current authentication practices, noting that they have been using Okta for identity management for about three years. 
John Whitworth initiated discussions around the desired functionalities of the SSO integration, confirming that users currently access applications through an Okta dashboard. Robert explained that external users are always prompted for multi-factor authentication (MFA), whereas internal users do not always receive this prompt. The discussion detailed the types of MFA used, including SMS, phone call, Okta Verify, and biometric options via Okta Fastpass, with a clear intention to move away from SMS and phone call verifications.
Regarding session management, it was noted that session timeouts typically last for about eight hours, although certain applications—especially those requiring administrative access—might enforce shorter timeouts of one hour or even less. While Robert stated that they enable single sign-out when applicable, he acknowledged that it is not a requirement.
As discussions progressed, John sought clarity on provisioning and deprovisioning processes. Robert confirmed that they utilize these mechanisms where possible and highlighted that only an admin could bypass SSO in cases of system issues or outages. It was clarified that the supported identity provider for these configurations will be SAML, aligning with current practices.
Finally, Sarah raised questions regarding the transition to SSO, prompting Chris to detail the automation advantages it will bring to user management processes, specifically in onboarding and offboarding scenarios and in fortifying security efforts across the organization.
