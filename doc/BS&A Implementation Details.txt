Integration Requirements and Pre-Requisites
BS&A Online Module (web payments) and/or Cash Receipting (counter payments)
The majority of BS&A billers host their own instance of BS&A. Any integration pre-requisites are determined by BS&A.

What BS&A products can IC support?  
It depends. 
Always ask the billers if they have purchased a module or check online. This is how you can determine what IC products to set up.
 You can also check yourself what modules the biller uses by going to

Invoice Types
See 
https://invoicecloud.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IM/pages/54001670/BS+A+Integration+Software+Details#Products
 for a breakdown on the use of CSRConnect (express payments) and their Cash Receipting software (web service payments).
BS&A calls IC Invoice Type IDs “Product IDs”. The Product ID is made up of the following values: BID-InvoiceTypeID
Supported invoice types (EBPP) - Utility, Summer Tax, Winter Tax and Village Tax
Supported invoice types (non-EBPP) - Delinquent Tax, Special Assessments, Building Permits, Business Licenses, and Misc. Receivables. 
Generally (95%), every BS&A biller needs an invoice type setup for General Receipts.
 
Standard Invoice Type IDs: 
Standard Invoice Type ID's MUST be used for the invoice types specified
Misc. Receivables 0
Permits 43
Business License 57
Summer Tax 7
Winter Tax 8
Village Tax and/or Delinquent Tax 95
General Receipts 68
Special Assessments 6
Utility - IC can support multiple InvoiceTypeIDs for utility based on the first value in the account number format (ex: 
V
###-##-####). These ID’s must be specified in the coding request - see Jira item and example below:
 
INT-3731
2278e126-27dc-36c8-aef9-a32d91bc7ad7

 Example: (integration also supports not pictured 162-G###-##-#### and 163-M###-##-####)
Virtual Site
BS&A Billers may not use the IC virtual site but it is always configured

Option Description
Details
52 (Invoice Type Option)
Any Utility InvoiceTypeID 
CloudCSRConnect- Use a partial match search on Account Number
Enable
Use Case: A resident has moved out, and their account has been conveyed. The new resident’s account has been created through the export file. Both the new resident, and old resident have an open invoice in BS&A online. If the old resident is making the jump, with the same account number being passed but different customer name – we do a partial account number match to the conveyed account. The customer name will do a full match, and then we create the invoice on the conveyed account. This allows the previous resident and the new resident to both have the ability to pay an invoice, if it is open in BSA Online.
53 (Invoice Type Option)
Any Utility InvoiceTypeID  
CloudCSRConnect- Use an exact match search on Customer Name
58 (Invoice Type Option)
Summer Tax
Winter Tax
Village Tax
Exclude expired invoices from customer search
Tax bills expire online (late Feb/early Mar) and were still rendering in customer search results. Turning this option on will exclude these invoices from the customer search so the customer will not see them and inquire.
Update this option using the below detail:
If a biller has Invoice Types 7 & 8 enabled, Option 58 would need to be checked under both of those invoice types.
Also, if a biller has Invoice Type 95 enabled with the alias of Village Tax, Option 58 would need to be checked.

Invoice Data
The same sample files are used for all integration coding, 
located on the box
.
These generic sample files are used for coding all biller implementations. 
IM should still request sample export files from the biller to import and use during testing.
BS&A Online Export
If multiple utility invoice types are required, include mapping - Example:

BS&A Data Sheet Required: Datasheet provides all implementation related items to BS&A for their coding/setup efforts. 
The below items should be on the BS&A Data Sheet:
Cash Receipting Codes
 Required: Codes derived from BS&A's Cash Receipting software and tie to Invoice Cloud invoice types/invoice type IDs (i.e. UB is Utility Billing and would tie to Invoice Cloud's Utility invoice type - typically invoice type ID 42). These codes must be acquired from the biller.
Product ID Required: Product ID = Invoice Cloud's BID + Invoice Type ID (i.e. 1298-42 for Tifton, GA's Utility Invoice Type). BS&A uses this value internally for both Cash Receipting and BS&A Online. This product ID will always be ####-##.
icimplementation@bsasoftware.com
Once Invoice Cloud coding has been completed and deployed
BS&A will complete their configuration and complete testing (~10 days)
