Queries:
1.How to create biller account and create refund transaction directly 
Can we get test inputs for test ? like test Biller, test Merchant, test etc..
Answer
: Getting a test Biller (which is a merchant) setup in the test environment is a request made to the Data Services team.  The IC tech lead can make this request on your behalf.
2. Can we create refund type transaction at backend without successful transaction ? 
Answer
: You can create a test terminal under a test Biller that will allow you to simulate processing a Sale transaction, settled the batch, and run a refund.
3. Reproduce the current refund process using api/database. / showcase on successful transaction creation via api/db.
Answer
: You can do this via POSTMAN and the Payment API.
4. What is biller management portal ?
Answer
: The Biller Portal is a website where a Biller goes to manage their invoices, invoice payments, and customers.
5. What is deadline time for dispute to expire if biller ignores the dispute ? in this cases who is at loss ?
Answer
: Dispute times can vary for a given processor.   Typically it is within a few weeks.  If the Biller ignores the dispute than their customer wins the dispute and the Biller ultimately is at a loss (after we debit them).
6. Credentials for CRM Invoice cloud portal (TestUser).
Answer
: You will have a test user (username = your email address) setup in the test environment.  Passwords are initially set and provided to you.  You will be required to change this password.
7. Working use case for CRM Invoice cloud to database and database to CRM Invoice Cloud (how the reflect or impact both the direction).
Answer
: The CRM manages data in the Biller’s shard databases.  You can use the UI to make changes in the database.  You can also make changes to your test Biller at a database level via SMS which would be reflected in the CRM when viewing your test Biller.
8. What is the shard portal for PSN Bill in dispute any impact and need to validate around it?
Answer
: PSN has their own CRM and systems for Billers.   They are integrated to the Gateway via the the web APIs.   UAT validations from our development would be at the API level.  PSN will be doing their own UAT as stakeholders on their integration to the Gateway APIs.
9. Story impact the RMM endpoint response? What is expected response after change.
Answer
: The API response will include a new property, the amount that we will be debiting the Biller for the RMM.  The debit amount is not always the total payment amount.  It can be less than (partial RMM) or equal to (full RMM) what was funded to the Biller.  An example, in some cases we need to exclude the convenience fee as it was not funded to the Biller even though is it consider part of the payment total amount.

 Need confirmation : Its not require any update data or record in db. require check for convenience fee in transaction. require get convenience fee stored procedure.
   Do we need to mark(Close) ACHRejectFunding? 
 Should we need to configure convenience fee in CRM Fee section or its in database stored procedure.

Queries:
1. Does the Hyperwallet morning balance only shows when there is a variance in balance?
Answer
: This report is used by finance to determine if we are out of balance.  In some cases they will input the balance from the source which will compare the inputted figure to the balance we have in our systems.  In some cases the source balance is pulled automatically.  Any variance between the source balance and the system balance is reflected and highlighted in this report to be worked.
2. Do we need to test through both UI and API as well? 
Answer
: Testing should cover the UI as that is what is used for UAT.   If there are any API calls behind the UI then those would also need to be covered. 
3. FCP, credential(TestUser), Biller where we need to investigate around. 
Answer
: You would need a test CRM user that has access rights to the FCP.   The FCP operates at a system wide level and not at a individual Biller level.
4. do we need to test before and after updating the hyperwallet balance through CRM console as well as API?
Answer
: Yes, in the test cases (out of balance or in balance) the before and after outcomes are important.

Answer
: Chargebacks are imported via the DSDR file.
How to set charge back fee value for testing.

We need to only test the biller statement through the CRM IC portal.
Answer
: The Biller statements are available in the Biller Portal.  That would be a final UAT test for IC Billers.  You would also test the reporting API which would be used by PSN to get the chargeback counts/details.

To confirm below scenario : ?

Day 2, Create a trans of sales for $1000 and refund of $2000. IC Net = -1000 (to hold at IC)
Day 3, Create a trans of sales for $500. Since sales is less than the Net. we will calculate balance and now the Net will be -500
Day 4, Create a trans of $2000. since IC Net is less than sales. 2000 will be given to Merchant without any calculations. IC Net still -$500
Day 5, Create a trans of of sales 500. Now calculations will apply as Net and Sales are equal and now Net becomes 0.
Note - Calc will happen only if the sale is less than or equal to current Net if Net is negative.
