Check Free - FISERV - Cash
Supported
Define the user story/entry point for the product and any details about implementation. Include the type of end user and how/why they use the product.
Only supported if biller uses our Online Bank Direct Product. 
This product would be used if municipalities allowed coordinating bill pay with customers banks. A payer will setup a recurring payment or autopay using their bank account and the bank sends over the paper check via FiServ to be applied to the customers account in IC.
CloudPay
Supported
CloudPayV1 is used for Over-the-Counter Payments
CloudPay Web Services
Not Supported
CloudStore
Supported
This is used for ad hoc non-invoice payments for certified copies of Death Certificate, Birth Certificate, Marriage Certificate, and Divorce Certificate. Biller would have to manually update payment in their CIS and IC doesn’t send CloudStore payments through the data pump.
Avitar has a standard setup for CloudStore. See CloudStore section on Implementation Details.
Ex: See Town of Derry (BID 654) or Town of Hampton Falls (BID 872)
