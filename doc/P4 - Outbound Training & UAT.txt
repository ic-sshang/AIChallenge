Training & Testing
FBO
 - 
Send ACH and Wire Transfer instruction to Biller
[Skip this step if using Open Banking]
The FBO Banking setup requires the funds for a payment to already be in the bank account before a payment can be issued.
For testing, the biller will need a minimum of $5.00 to be deposited into their funding account. They can either wire the fund or ACH transfer.
Transcard will send FBO account details once the account setup is complete. Forward these to the biller in an 
ENCRYTED
 email including the below language.
Use the below account details to fund the FBO account that was set up for [BILLER NAME]. We recommend an initial transfer of $5-$10 in order to test the payment methods being offered.
