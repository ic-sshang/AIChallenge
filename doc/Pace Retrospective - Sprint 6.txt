We have lots of dependencies on US team.  going forward this should be reduced by gaining more knowledge on the product.
Team to start review of our own stories.
Will discuss the planned leaves at the start of Planning session
Unplanned leaves towards the end of the sprint
Testing challenges on few storis or issues, we need to identify a way to get this sorted.
Completed good number of stories. done research on spike items which is good thing to take up.
Handling standup on our own
Thank You, Sriram for working on new DEV test environment setup and testing.
Thank You Sidd for help gaining knowledge in Scrum methodologies

Need to gain more domain knowledge to fill the knowledge gap
Action items:
We need to share knowledge on the work items we are working on. this helps to fill the knowledge gap.
More functional session on product will be helpful.
