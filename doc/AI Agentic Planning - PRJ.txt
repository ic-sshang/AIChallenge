Evolve Biller AI Reporting (Version Next)
Switch to a assistance type feature that does not just surface data.
Ideas
“Help me create a campaign to improve my adoption of paperless”
“Reconciliation workflow” 
Vikki at Invoice Cloud has run books that her team performs on behalf of billers
Example 
Upload bank statement
Process against payment reports
Provide possible answer to reconciliation question
“Auto Match OBD”
Provide AI the unmatched payment data set
Provide AI the Invoice data set
Create/expose AI to a API that matches a payment to a invoice
AI can find and present possible matches and get confirmation from the user to action
integrate to billers bank reporting (Plaid) have reconciliation with minimal user provided data requirements 
Dream big do not focus on the how and instead on the dream (what would our customers love that would make our product revolutionary and best of breed) 
think like star trek tri quarter (computer… do this for me)
Planning
Identify the “operations” we want AI to perform on behalf of the user
Create RESTful  APIs (Open API 3.0) that expose the required functionality needed to complete the operation
Use Azure AI Agent Service to orchestrate the request from the user to invoking the required APIs to action on their behalf 
Nick has analytics around what CS needs from a top ten workflows that they are doing on behalf of billers
