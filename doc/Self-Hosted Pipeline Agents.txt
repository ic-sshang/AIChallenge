We run our own Azure DevOps agents in addition to the Microsoft-hosted agents that are available. There are some primary reasons for this:
Pre-installation of proper tooling for our processes
Network access to required resources for our processes
Caching of dependencies to decrease build time
Server Agents
We have 3 Windows servers that we use as build agents. 
IC-Azure 
Primarily runs application builds
IC-Azure2019 
Primarily builds and executes test suites
Selenium 
Primarily builds and executes test suites. Also hosts legacy Selenium grid, which is not frequently used anymore
Container Agents
In addition to these server agents, we have a few container-based agents. These run in the Platform Tooling AKS, in the DevTest subscription. They are configured so that they can dynamically scale up or down in number, although this feature is not currently enabled. We build and maintain our own container image for these agents.
