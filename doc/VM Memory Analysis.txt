How to Capture a Memory Dump
Before anything else, make sure the server from which you’re pulling the memory dump is 
pulled from rotation
.
 Capturing a memory dump does not seem to have any impact, but we’re better safe than sorry.
Another note: 
treat memory dumps as sensitive information!
 They’ll often contain Payer information, possibly including unencrypted credit card info.
RDP into the server
Run 
Task Manager
 as an admin
Navigate to the 
Details
 tab
Ensure the column 
Command Line
 is included in the view (may need to right click and add the column)
Find the 
w3wp.exe
 process where 
Command Line
 includes the target app pool’s name
Right click this process and hit 
Create Dump File
This will output a 
dmp
 file to your user’s folder on the C: drive. 
Don’t leave it there! 
Copy/upload the file wherever you need it to be, then 
permanently delete it 
from the server.
