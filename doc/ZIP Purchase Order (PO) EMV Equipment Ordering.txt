ZIP Purchase Order (PO) EMV Equipment Ordering
Description
This Runbook will outline the steps necessary to create a PO which is necessary for EMV equipment ordering.  This task is completed by the Delivery Team in support of New Biller and Add on Projects.
Contents

Summary
Once boarding confirms VAR has been received and sent to Bluefin
, you must order the hardware from Bluefin, which includes submitting a PO in ZIP. 
Your approval of the ZIP PO will send the order to Bluefin to be shipped and the biller will receive in 5-10 days of your approval. 
The card readers should not be ordered more than 6 weeks before go-live. Early shipping can cause issues for the biller:
Testing must be completed with 30 days of shipment. If the biller is not ready to test the initial warranty expires
Devices are shipped with the latest updates, but must be online to receive future deployments. These are put on hold and must be manually requested if the readers are offline for more than 45 days.
Once the task is requested the biller will receive the devices in 5-10 business days.
Y
ou can leave the ZIP PO approval as pending. Make sure to set a reminder to approve the request at least 14 days before the biller wants to receive the hardware. One benefit to a Biller of waiting to receive the hardware closer to go live date, is the EMV device will have the latest software version updates and will likely not need to have updates installed before Network Authorization Testing.
If you do not have access to ZIP, please reach out to your manager.

What happens after I submit a PO Request?
After submitting a PO request for new EMV card readers, the PO must follow a specific approval process. Ashley Kashmer is the usual approver at the Procurement level and if you need to expedite a PO, reach out to your manager and they can contact Ashley for requesting the expedite.  
Reviewing requests
Steps
Description
Example
1
Notification Email
You will receive an email saying that you requested the EMV card reader immediately after submitting.
2
Final Approval
The PO will go through approvals (1-2 days) and you will receive updated emails telling you that approval stages are complete and what stages are left for approval. Ultimately you will get an email when the EMV reader has completed the approval process asking you to approve the request to go to Bluefin. 
You can either approve directly from the email or select “View Request” and approve on the ZIP site.
Your approval of the PO will actually send the order to Bluefin to be shipped and the biller will receive in 5-10 days of your approval. If the biller does not want to receive the device at that time, you can leave the approval as pending. Make sure to set the reminder to approve the request at least 14 days before the biller wants to receive the hardware. (Please keep in mind the above points on why a Biller would not want to receive EMV card reader devices too soon).
