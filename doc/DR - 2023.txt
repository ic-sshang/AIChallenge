This section captures efforts related to DR tests planned for 2023
SQL Failover test
Non production
Spin up a DevTest West SQL Server, add the databases we have on the east, then enable the failover group. - 
 
Identify an application we can use on DevTest that can be regression tested and has the ability to connect to the database using 
ADO.net
 - 
 
Likely MyIIS or the RestAPI.
Identify or create tests that can be run through BlazeMeter to get a sense of the latency. - 
 / 
 
Run three types of load tests.
Run the app as is.
Run the app with the failover group connection string change.
Run the app with the failover group connection string change and the failover enabled to send traffic to the west. 
Things where we need to have further discussions on:
Move a devtest VM over to the west to test out latency from west to east. Needs input from 
 
.
Utilizing devtest 14 (prod mirror) to run this test. Needs input from 
 since it's used as a prod mirror it needs to be the same as production.
Alternative is to open up another url we can use.
http://test1.invoicecloud.com
  - Need to sync with the EMV team if it is being used. - 
 
qa-regression.invoicecloud.com
 - Needed for regression testing. 
Will need to remove the IP restriction.
qa1.invoicecloud.com
 - outdated, but can work. 
Will need to remove the IP restriction.
qa2.invoicecloud.com
 - outdated, but can work. 
Will need to remove the IP restriction.
qa3.invoicecloud.com
 - no servers behind it, so we can reuse, but will need to update iis to have the bindings. 
Will need to remove the IP restriction.
