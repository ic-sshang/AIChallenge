RTDR
S&S provides 2 endpoints (CIS Service and PayConnect Service) which will cover RTDR, Data Pump, and Bill Presentment.
S&S sends both a BAF and utilizes RTDR. RTDR will overwrite any information sent in the BAF.
We have a set of web services for RTDR that are custom to S&S. The web service docs for S&S cannot be found on our doc site.
We will perform a RTDR each time S&S makes a "jump" into IC. During RTDR, we will check to see if we have an invoice for the account number that is passed in the custom URL. If we do not have an invoice or customer record for that particular account number, we will create them "on the fly" based on the information that is returned from our RTDR call.

Each night, S&S billers perform "system maintenance", which includes taking a backup of their entire enQuesta system. During this time, the S&S web services (RTDR and Data Pump) are both unavailable. To mitigate any payment posting issues, we hardcode a window of time per biller, that we will not send transactions through the data pump or RTDR. Once the window is over we will begin sending transactions again. This will need to be asked by the IM during Implementation and sent to IT with the Coding information.

Data Pump
S&S provides 2 endpoints (CIS Service and PayConnect Service) which will cover RTDR, Data Pump, and Bill Presentment.
S&S has their own Data Pump called S&S Queue Processing. Their Data Pump has special functionality that queues payments for all S&S billers.

When we post payments through the data pump, we also send the batch date. Depending on the timing, we will add days as necessary so the posting date is based on the next business day. Upon batch close, we will add an additional day to transactions being posted, so they show in a separate batch in enQuesta (CIS). Most S&S billers have specific batch numbers, tender types, and dates to add logic for the Data Pump. Please consult Implementation project files for specifics on each biller.

S&S provides 2 endpoints (CIS Service and PayConnect Service) which will cover RTDR, Data Pump, and Bill Presentment.
The integration supports PDF Linking. If the biller wants to provide bill images outside of the standard integration process, the setup would need to be handled directly with the biller. Template is not supported.

AgentConnect
Not Supported
Check Free - FISERV - Cash
Supported
Only supported if biller uses our Online Bank Direct Product. 
This product would be used if municipalities allowed coordinating bill pay with customers banks. A payer will setup a recurring payment or autopay using their bank account and the bank sends over the paper check via FiServ to be applied to the customers account in IC.
CloudPay
Not Supported
CloudPay Web Services
Not Supported
CloudStore
Supported
This is used for ad hoc non-invoice payments. Biller would have to manually update payment in their CIS and IC doesn’t send CloudStore payments through the data pump.
CSRConnect
Not Supported
No longer implemented - applies to legacy integrations only. 
EMV
Supported*
*For Biller Portal payments only
IVR
Supported
S&S has a relationship with Selectron. Most S&S billers will have Selectron IVR that is integrated with enQuesta. Selectron will code to our IVR payment web services, using Utility Search 2.
Each biller that has a relationship with Selectron will provide a contact for IC to work with.
S&S will include any necessary paperwork to Selectron for the coding change for IC to process payments

Account Registration:
 
Account Linking
Supported
Handled by partner based on SSO criteria. 
       Multi-User Log In
Required (for Lite)*
*Referred by S&S as “Lite”, during the SSO, S&S will pass IC tokens that allow login. Along with the tokens, they will pass all of the accounts that should be associated with that particular sign in. This allows billers to have multiple people registered to the same account. This functionality is only part of the "McLogin" (Multi-user) project in IC. Any biller not using “Lite” will not have Multi-User Login. 
       Co-Owner Registration
Not Supported
 
 SSO
Required
S&S billers almost always use SSO. We have custom links that "jump" customers from WebConnect to IC, based on the instance name. WebConnect is the legacy SSO. S&S is encouraging billers to upgrade to SilverBlaze/Capricorn. 
SilverBlaze is S&S’s new Portal Solution. The product that SilverBlaze offers is called Capricorn. We support an Embedded iFrame with Capricon. 
We have a set of web services for SSO that are custom to S&S. The web service docs for S&S cannot be found on our doc site.
In June 2019 we went live with new SSO web services that allow S&S to create a token with IC. IC no longer stores the username or password for any user, and S&S "controls" all credentials for logging in. During the SSO, S&S will pass IC tokens that allow login. Along with the tokens, they will pass all of the accounts that should be associated with that particular sign in. This allows billers to have multiple people registered to the same account. This functionality is only part of the "McLogin" (Multi-user) project in IC.
AutoPay Collection Date
Supported
BIF includes indicator/dates for autopay dates.
Batch Closure
Supported
Custom
Invoice Cloud Batch Closure times must match S&S batch closure times. 
When we post payments through the data pump, we also send the batch date. Depending on the timing, we will add days as necessary so the posting date is based on the next business day. Upon batch close, we will add an additional day to transactions being posted, so they show in a separate batch in enQuesta (CIS).
