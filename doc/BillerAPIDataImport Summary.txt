Purpose
This document summarizes the the integration types and functionality of the BillerAPIDataImport process for 
BIF-312
2278e126-27dc-36c8-aef9-a32d91bc7ad7
System Jira
. 
Summary
Integration Flavors
The application supports two distinct data import integrations:
Epic
: This integration fetches data via an HTTP GET request from a configured URL. It uses Basic Authentication. The response is read as a string, backed up to a local file, and then converted to a byte array for upload.
TruePoint
: This integration retrieves data from a JSON-based web API. It makes an HTTP POST request with a JSON body and an API key in the header. The response is parsed, and an invoice file is generated from the data. 
Process Flow
The application follows a straightforward process for importing data:
Initialization
: The application starts and validates command-line arguments (
billerid
, 
stratusfileid
, 
importerbase
).
Importer Selection
: Based on the 
importerbase
 argument, a factory method (
GetImporterBase
) instantiates the appropriate integration class (
Epic
 or 
clsTruePointUtility
).
Data Retrieval (
PullFile
): The 
PullFile
 method of the selected importer is called. This method is responsible for connecting to the external system (either via HTTP GET for Epic or HTTP POST for TruePoint) and returning the data as a byte array.
File Backup
: The retrieved data is backed up locally.
File Upload (
UploadFile
): The 
ImporterBase.UploadFile
 method calls the 
UploadStratusInvoiceFileBinary
 SOAP web service method, sending the byte array to the Stratus platform.
Logging
: The application logs the outcome of the import process.

Observations
The application acts as a middleware or bridge, fetching data from third-party systems and forwarding it to the Stratus web service.
No significant data processing or transformation occurs within this application. It primarily handles data retrieval and transmission.
