Background
The purpose of this page is to set a procedure for the presentation of the Bug items that are created for Bug Court. Members of the SRE team should present their bugs in a similar fashion to increase the quality of discussion during the meeting.
The outcomes of following this etiquette guide are the following:
To have clear objectives during the meeting to remain focused and productive
Increase accountability for the product teams
Building rapport with the product teams
Presentation Procedure
This is the generic procedure that should be followed when presenting a bug item.
Introduce the bug item by addressing the product or repo in which the bug was found.
Example: 
”Hi everyone, today I will be presenting a bug found in ScheduledPaymentProcessing”
Before explaining the bug, state the team to which you think the bug will fall and address the product manager of that team.
Example: 
“I think this item falls under Team SPAM’s domain“
Begin explaining the bug by stating the repo, page, line number, and stored procedure if applicable.
Example: 
“This bug was found in the ScheduledPaymentProcessing repo, in Module1.vb on line 240.“
Describe the fault of the bug. Make sure to show and explain your Visual Proof
Allow time for the product managers or product engineers to ask questions and discuss what product team the bug should be assigned to.
If you are the final member to present a bug, after the discussion related to your bug item has concluded, ask members of Client Services if there are any backlogged items that they would like to escalate.
Situational Steps
If you have invited a member of CS to join Bug Court, acknowledge their attendance and ask them if they would like to expand on the impact of the bug. This should be done after describing the fault of the bug, during the discussion with the product team.
