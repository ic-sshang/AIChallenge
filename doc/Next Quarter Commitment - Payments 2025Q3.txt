Descriptor Changes 
 
 Discovery: 
Completed (We have received a sign-off from CS, implementation team and chase team to add “PMT” as suffix to resolve the item descriptor error codes with least amount of change.    
     Delivery:
As part of phase 1, we will add “PMT” as Suffix for Item descriptor for 8 billers (reported by Chase) by end of Q2 and validate the changes with Chase post implementation.
Once the error codes for 8 billers get resolved and received a sign-off , we will make the change for all other item descriptors in Q3 (August)
     Risks:
Incase if the change suggested by Chase (Adding suffix to existing item descriptor values) is implemented and still error code gets reported, we may need to relook at the solution again with Chase.
Zip code updates
Discovery:  
Complete by End of Q2.
Delivery:
Potential solutions include:
Adding front-end validation within payer UI flows
Implementing server-side validation in web service endpoints
Enriching missing or invalid ZIP codes via backend middleware or API gateway logic.
The goal for Q3 is to:
Deliver a solution that enforces ZIP code validation across all payment entry points
Minimize impact on existing customers and transaction volume
Risks:
Customer disruption due to validation failures, especially since many transactions bypass the UI and flow directly through APIs
Transaction Amount Validation
Discovery:  
Complete by End of Q2.
Delivery:  
Complete by End of Q3
Risks:
Awaiting clarification from Chase on how transaction amounts and line item totals are calculated and validated. Delays in receiving this information may impact the timeline for finalizing the solution.
