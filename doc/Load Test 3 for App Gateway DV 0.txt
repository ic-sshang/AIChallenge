Requests Per Minute
From Cloudflare we determined that we get 940 million requests per month which equates to 21,461 requests per minute.
940,000,000 / 43800 = 21,461
We achieved a maximum of 100k requests per minute and a consistent load of between 50k and 60k requests per minute.  We observed a max traffic spike during the day in production traffic coming in from Cloudflare of 50k requests per minute via NewRelic query by 
 , so the consistent load of 50k to 60k per minute for 25 minutes should be a valid real-world load to test with.
