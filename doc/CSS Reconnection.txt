Customer Self Service Initiative 
Customer Self Service Initiative 
We believe in Enterprise Utility there is a need for more customer self service features. These features are expected by Enterprise billers as many of them already have these. Benefits of customer self service tools are less work for the biller as payers can help themselves. There is also a need to expand Customer Self into the Insurance vertical however as seen below the majority of billers requesting these features are in Utility. 
Customer Self Service Objective and Audience asking for these features:

 Problem Alignment
Problem Alignment
Currently our GUB biller base must handle disconnection and reconnection of service manually or with another outside system. This creates more work for our GUB billers of managing when disconnection notices are sent to payers, organizing and tracking disconnection and then further helping payers make payments for reconnection. For example Town of Dartmouth handles disconnection notices completely separate outside IC’s platform and then typically takes reconnection fee payments via phone or in person. This creates strain for the payer and more work for the biller to manage disconnection and reconnection. 
Further more we have Collier County who currently uses Cloud Store to require payers to make a reconnection fee payment to restore service. This is a work around and not an ideal flow for the payer or biller. Below is an example of the message. 
Therefore we have an opportunity to introduce a disconnection and reconnection feature to existing and new billers. This will help IC improve the biller’s daily lives as we remove manual work, and support the payer experience to be online, reducing in person or phone interactions with the biller. 
 Objective
Objective 
The objective of this project is to introduce a new feature of disconnection and reconnection to our existing biller base and new billers. This project aligns with InvoiceCloud’s strategic goal to introduce more customer self service products so our payers have a smooth customer experience and do not rely on the biller’s customer support so much. This will then help our billers. 
This aligns with InvoiceCloud’s three year roadmap plan to support Enterprise Utility in the first year with customer self service and in app messaging features. We can market this feature as an add on to our existing product for GUB billers and we could also then collect revenue on more payments - ie being the reconnection fees.

Phased Approach to addressing Reconnection needs across billers
One goal is to have a staggered approach to address most reconnection use cases while delivering value as soon as we can. See Timeline view for details.

Impact
Biller portal users 
Biller portal users will need to see the status of the account on the customer profile, and be able to take payment for reconnection. 
Main task: view customer’s disconnection/reconnection status, and possibly help disconnected payers make payment. 
Payers
 Payers will need to be notified of disconnection and steps on how to reconnect their account. 
Main task: Pay past due amount and reconnection fee to restart service. 
 CIS 
 CIS systems will need to work with IC and utilize IC’s API spec for sending account statuses related to disconnection/ reconnection. 
Main task: handling the actual shut off of service, and alerting IC of account status.
 
User Interaction and Design 
User Interaction and Design
Which screens are affected, in which systems? 
Virtual Site: customerselectedinvoices, checkout route. Desktop + Mobile needed.
Customer Portal: customerwelcome, checkout route. Desktop + Mobile needed. 
Biller Portal: updates to Customer profile. Desktop needed. 
Email notification: new email alerting payer of disconnection and how to reconnect service.
Email notification: new email to alert payer they are At Risk of Disconnection.  
What technical limitations are we working under?
we are dependent on a CIS software partner to send IC the status of an account.

 Components Impacted

Impact
Docs Site 
We will have to add a section in the Docs site for the integration documentation for CIS systems. 
 Virtual Site 
 We will add account status on accounts in Search and Checkout flow on the virtual site.
Customer Portal
 We will add account status within the customer portal
Email notifications 
We will make two new email notifications - one Account is Disconnected, and Account is Reconnected. 
CRM 
We will probably need custom messaging to be stored in the CRM for each status that is sent to IC. 
Biller Portal 
We need to add account status on the customer profile and we need to update the shopping cart in the biller portal to account for the reconnection fee. 
RTDR and Data Pump
Will need to update to hold account status. 
 Technical Architecture
Technical Architecture
Questions from Kick Off 
Should we build fee to be able to be RTDR updated?
 how do we treat the reconnection fee as a invoice type, a cloud store? ----> it comes through the API, no storing as an invoice type
How do we handle the past due - the existing rules of what the biller has should be respected? ----> whatever is in API 
Can the payer also add other invoices to the cart? -----> Yes 
Will this be one type of fee across invoice type? water fee = water invoice , electric fee = electric invoice -----> not doing as invoice type , but through API
Will we accommodate variations of what past due invoice + fee, just fee, just oldest invoice first etc? -----> Yes 
Does the fee increase over time if not reconnected? -----> This could be an option. We need to build for this, need a way to call back / get updated fee.

 Business Logic 
Business Logic
The business logic we want to implement are in API calls with the following data sent to IC / IC sends to software partner. 
Disconnection sent to IC
account number 
customer name (if we need for validation for this?)
invoice number / Type? (most recent invoice must be paid, or oldest in invoice has to be paid first, but not specific) 
Disconnected flag y/n 
Reconnection fee amount
Reconnection fee required y/n. Reconnection fee is treated like donations. 
(1) All past due required y/n (is all past due amount required to be paid?)
(2) % of past due amount required to be paid (nice to have) Minimum required? We want them tell us the amount. 
we would be applying the payment to the invoice type and (3) paying oldest invoice first.  
We need to have the invoice included. Have one single invoice configured in the CRM and the fee comes over - we make it as the same invoice type, but its just the fee.
Copy to display in customer portal / virtual site 
Reconnection fee that is housed in the CRM - so we only take in the flag of disconnection.

6/20 Meeting Shannon, Mark, Shelby  
options discussed for fee:
reconnection fee is in CRM 
fee is a separate invoice type 
fee is same as the standard invoice type and we flag/see it as a fee. 
6/21 Meeting
need data model to house the core delinquent fields are shown
issue of the two files (actuals and delinquent) and we need to show two images possibly for actual bill, delinquent bill.
