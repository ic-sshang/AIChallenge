Current Major Velocity issues
Platform unknowns (
Mentioned above
)
Application unknowns
Containerization readiness
Testing knowledge and ability to test (environment parity)
DR Architecture Pivot options
Compute platform can be shifted other options (previously explored):
VMs
AppServices
Azure Service Fabric
Recommendations (regarding DR with k8s)
Technology stack:
Changing technology stack does not solve the above issues impacting velocity. 
No change in recommendation for - k8s migration for DR
Process changes:
To gain scope of unknowns, dedicated efforts of analysis for : 
Dependencies
Containerization readiness of all web apps in scope
Test case coverages (this metrics should already exist)
(App SME support needed)
Replan roadmap:
with 
SWAT Team approach
 or 
with only k8s migration platform team members approach
Notes - 12th Jan 2024
Bring Proxy’s to a logical conclusion, by end of ??
Focus shifted to:
Work stream 1: 
Define approach of auto creation of integration tests
Implement integration tests
Work stream 2:
Regression and UAT environments
Once #1 at a usable state, replan and start k8s migration.
Reconvene 26th Jan 2024
