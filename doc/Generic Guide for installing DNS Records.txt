Follow this step-by-step guide to install DNS records:
Step 1: Log into Your DNS Provider
 Your DNS provider is where your domain’s DNS records are managed.

Note: Sometimes, your DNS provider is different from the place you bought your domain.

Not sure who your DNS provider is?
Use this lookup tool: 
https://who.is
  → enter your domain → scroll to “Name Servers” — this will show your DNS host.
Step 2: Select the Domain
Once logged in, select the domain you want to update.
Step 3: Go to DNS Settings
Find the option called “Manage DNS,” “DNS Settings,” or “DNS Records.” It varies slightly across platforms but serves the same purpose.
 
Step 4: Add DNS Records
Learn about DNS records fields (click to expand)
Field
What it means 
Type
Record type: TXT, MX, or CNAME
Host/Name
The subdomain or @ (for root domain)
Value
The key or destination data (e.g., SPF/DKIM key)
Priority
For MX records: controls mail server priority
TTL
“Time To Live” – set this to 600 for faster DNS propagation. It is measured in seconds.

DNS records of DKIM & SPF
Steps to add TXT records for DKIM in your DNS records
Type: 
Select type as TXT.
Host/Name
: Enter only the subdomain part. For example, if your host name is:
”smtp._domainkey.mydomain.com”, you should enter only: “smtp._domainkey”.
If there is no subdomain, use @ to indicate your root domain.
Value
: Copy and paste as it is.
TTL(Time to Live)
: Set this to 600 for faster DNS propagation. If 600 isn’t listed, choose “Custom” and enter 600 manually.
Repeat
 the steps for second TXT records
note
Note: Paste the entire key without adding any extra spaces—especially in the middle of the string. Even a single space in copied value can prevent verification.

When you select type as CNAME then you will find below fields:
Step 5: Wait for DNS to reflect these changes across the internet.
note
Note: It can take up to 24 to 48 hours for DNS changes to propagate across the internet. In our experience, it usually happens faster than that, but don’t get discouraged if it doesn’t happen immediately.
