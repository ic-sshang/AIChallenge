 Objective
To implement the "Custom Email Domain" feature, allowing billers to send email notifications from their own domain instead of the Invoice Cloud domain. This aims to enhance legitimacy and trust for payers, thereby improving key metrics such as conversion rate, email open rate, CTR, and revenue.
 Why it is important?
Trust and Legitimacy
: Payers are more likely to trust and engage with emails from a familiar domain.
Improved Metrics
: Enhanced trust can lead to higher conversion rates, better email open rates, increased CTR for reminders, and more timely payments, positively impacting revenue.
Customer Demand
: Billers have provided qualitative feedback indicating a strong desire for this feature to improve communication with their payers.
 Release Plan
Phase 1A : Alpha Testing
: Conduct initial testing with a test biller account.

Phase 1B: Beta Testing: 
Release with 1 biller (Texas Mutual Insurance) and receive feedback.

Phase 1C: Pilot Launch
: Expand to 10 more billers to validate performance and feedback.

Reason for delay
The following phased rollout plan was initially proposed but was impacted due to resourcing constraints, scope adjustments, and multiple blockers in testing process.
Expected Date for Release: 30th June
Phase 2: 
Biller Portal: 
Allow biller to add custom domain by themselves.
Incremental Rollout: 
Incremental deployment to all billers based on feedback and stability.

 Question
Are we assuming that all billers have the technical capability to set up DNS records?
Answer: No, that’s the reason we have 2 separate follow for tech & non-tech user to setup DNS records.
How will we get the CTR of email notifications?
Answer: Mailgun has click count.
How will we configure Tracking Records in DNS settings since there is no API available?
Answer: Getting tracking records with sending records using API.
How will we ensure that emails are being sent from custom email domain?
Answer: We have total 36 emails which can be trigger and verify (
