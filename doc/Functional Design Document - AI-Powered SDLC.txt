1. Purpose
Define functional behavior of AI-Powered SDLC: how users interact, how actions flows through the system, and how governance and approvals are enforced.
2. Actors
Developer:
 Requests PR reviews, approves patches, generate code.
SDET:
 Requests Xray test generation, approves outputs.
PM:
 Uses PlanningAgent for story generation.
EM:
 Audits, defines policies, monitors.
Release Team:
 Create release branch and builds, validate release, generate release report.
3. Use Cases
PR Review:
 
/ic-agenthub review-pr <id>
 → CodeAgent, SecurityAgent propose comments/patches.
SOAP→REST / VB→C# Migration:
 
/ic-agenthub generate-code <Jira>
 , 
/ic-agenthub migrate-code <jira>
 →Multi-step agent workflow with design → code → tests → PR.
Xray Test Generation:
 
/ic-agenthub gen-xray STORY-123
 → XrayAgent generates or find similar xray tests and then link to Jira.
Create release branch and trigger builds:
 
/ic-agenthub gen-release <json>
 → ReleaseAgent generates release branches and trigger builds.
4. User Journeys
PR Review example:
Developer triggers Slack command 
/ic-agenthub review-pr 123
.
Orchestrator creates run → publishes to Service Bus.
Multi-Agent host consume the request and pass/fan out to appropriate Agent(s).  
Agent(s) call the relevant MCP server (context and tooling layer) and get response.
MCP server authenticate and make API calls to engineering assets and services
Aggregator compiles results into ProposedActions.
Slack shows proposed actions → Approve/Reject.
5. Functional Requirements
R1: Orchestrator accepts RunRequests and persists metadata.
R2: Agents consume run events through multi agent host and produce structured outputs.
R3: Aggregator synthesizes results and generates ProposedActions.
R4: Users approve ProposedActions via Slack or SPA.
R5: MCP Servers enforce safe access to tools.
R6: Logs and audit records.
6. Non-Functional Requirements
Security: All calls authenticated via Azure AD; RBAC enforced.
Create Audit logs and retained.
7. UX Requirements
Slack App:
 Slash commands, Block Kit approval messages.
React SPA:
 Run dashboard, response viewer, audit and metrics.
