Objective: 
Decouple Non-Prod and Prod networks and create a network boundary
Rollback Plan: 
We have created separate Route tables for Non-Production and Production in the Primary Subscription. If there is an issue we cannot solve quickly, we can simply apply the old route table that is currently applied to the subnet.
Non Production Workflow:
 Create Route Table
Breakdown InternalNetwork Vnet routes
Prune unneeded routes
Update/Verify Palo Alto Firewall rules are in place for each subnet being migrated
Determine tests to be associated with each migrated subnet
Switch subnet route table to the new route table
Monitor Palo Alto during migration
Production Workflow:
 Create Route Table
Breakdown InternalNetwork Vnet routes
Prune unneeded routes
Update/Verify Palo Alto Firewall rules are in place for each subnet being migrated
Determine tests to be associated with each migrated subnet
Choose maintenance windows
Switch subnet route table to the new route table
Monitor Palo Alto during migration
