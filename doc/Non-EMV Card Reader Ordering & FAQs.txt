SRED Implementation
Option 1 - Partner Integration
Partners can use either POSConnect or CloudPay v2 to activate the SRED readers.
POSConnect
This is a legacy solution that some partners still use.
CRM Settings:
Enable 
POSConnect 
under 
Products
POSConnect needs to be installed locally. This is usually managed by the CIS contact so that the correct settings are enabled.
The biller can install the most recent version through the Biller Portal - Support - Documentation - Integration Documentation - Specifications - CloudPOSConnect 
Library of all versions available here: 
https://invoicecloud.app.box.com/folder/650958113
The CIS will need to train the biller on how to activate the reader. 
 CloudPay v2
This is the new solution that will be the primary integration going forward - 
Cloud Payments v2 Overview
Confirm if partner has completed their coding to CloudPay v2
If Yes - Advise the biller that the partner will need update their configuration to "Allow Swipe"
If No - Open SE case to support partner in development/testing
Create API Key - 
**Skip if biller is already has a CloudPay v2 API Key**
Select 
Application API Keys 
in 
Biller Portal-Support-Documentation/APIs
 
 
Select 
Create New Application Key 
 
Complete 
Application Name
 field and set to 
Active 
and select 
Create New Application Key 
 
Copy full API Key and send to Biller/CIS point of contact.
Partner will need to enable the Swipe option in their API call and train the biller on how to use the readers.
Option 2 - Biller Portal 
Most Billers will use SREDs through the biller portal:
You can download and send this doc to the biller:

Q & A
Question:
 Can you use Magtek readers for all integrations? 
Answer:
 Magtek swipes for BS&A are strictly readers. They act as "keyboards" to add the data from the strip but that's it. Only the EMV readers support Apple/Google Pay

Question:
 Why is the card reader not activating in CIS software? 
Answer:
 POSConnect is either not running or on too low a version. Navigate to the Invoice Cloud folder in the Start menu and restart the program:
 
POSConnect will now be showing in the tray: 
 
If there is still an issue, they should check their version by right clicking the POSConnect icon in the tray and selecting About. 
 
The current version will be listed in the Integration Documentation in the Biller Portal: 
https://www.invoicecloud.com/Documentation/FileSpecifications/CloudConnect.aspx?path=Specifications%2FCloudPOSConnect
If the installed version is less than the download file the biller should uninstall POSConnect and delete the .dll files that may remain after the uninstall:

Question:
 Biller's SRED Card Reader does not work with the Invoice Cloud Biller Portal. What is the next step?
Answer: 
Ask the biller the following:
Do they use a remote desktop solution that does not allow USB Redirection? 
If yes, the connection will not be successful. They will need to enable that or access the Biller portal on the actual PC
Try a different USB port and/or a USB connection on a different computer.
 If the issue remains the device is likely defective and needs to be replaced

Question: 
My SREDKey displays "Key Not Injected" when I tried to manually enter the card number and swipe a card. How can I fix this? 
Answer 
The biller can request a card reader swap. A new reader will be shipped with a return label. IC will address the injection with IDTech.
