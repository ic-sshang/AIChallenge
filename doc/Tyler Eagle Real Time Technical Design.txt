Payer Experience
Payers will access Invoice Cloud from the Biller website (URL redirect). Payers will use the IC Virtual Site and Customer Portal.
Additionally, Tyler Eagle has a account lookup style portal. Users can lookup their account and be redirected to Invoice Cloud for payment (Cloud Pay v1)
InvoiceNumber sent in redirect should be to one that already exists. (AccountNumber-TaxYear-PaymentType)

Suggested Tyler Eagle Improvements
Three versions of Tax Bill
Any solution should be reviewed with biller before implementing to see if they agree with approach.
Currently, Billers links to existing bills in IC with Cloud Pay v1 from the Eagle portal. They can link to the first half, full, or second half of the bill. These are three different bills in IC. The links are set regardless of current balance or if user has paid first half or not. 
This makes it difficult to dynamically take payments on second half bills ONLY for users for that have paid the first half once first half is past due. IC accepts payment on bill from redirect even if it’s expired in IC.
Potential fix:
Once the first half bill becomes past due, IC automates a process to deactivate the first / second half of any users that have not paid the first half amount (balance due <= 0). They would only have the option to pay the bill in full. 
Any user that has paid the first half would have either all three bills still open or just the second half and full bill (biller to decide)
Issue: If an expired bill is redirected to with Cloud Pay v1, IC will still take payment on that bill.
Either:
a. Once the first half bill becomes past due, the biller only links to the full payment version of bill with a message that if the user has paid their first half and wants to pay their second half to lookup the bill in Invoice Cloud. This requires the biller to edit the links to only have full payment option once first half is past due.
b. IC enhances Cloud Pay to create functionality that if a bill is linked to that is expired, user gets an error page instead of a payment route
IVR Issue:
IVR only links the bill with the soonest due date, this is the first. There is not an option to link to only the full payment option.
