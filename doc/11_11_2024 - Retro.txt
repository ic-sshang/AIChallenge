password: iae11F@%
Key Takeaways:
most common user flow for search: 1. search 2. filter 3. sort
autocomplete is now an expected behavior for search bars
these autocomplete sections are most effective when the results are broken into categories
i.e. links, pages, knowledge base articles
When a user clicks on an auto-complete option it should trigger the search right away
Search bar width should be at least 60 characters on desktop and 45 characters on mobile
