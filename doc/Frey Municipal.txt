Summary
Frey Municipal Software is a partner with InvoiceCloud for utility billing.  The integration is batch with the only real time component being PDF linking.  
 A Frey implementation uses their portal, CUBIC, as the front end. With an InvoiceCloud integration, a OTP option is also available on the CUBIC login page. Note: Brownsburg, IN received a special exception to use InvoiceCloud as the front end experience.
