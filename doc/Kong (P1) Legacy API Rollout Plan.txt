Plan
The below APIs on the domain (www.invoicecloud.com) have been identified for routing and pass-through via Kong.  These APIs will be rerouted to fall under under the (
api.invoicecloud.com
) domain.
These APIs are Kong roadmap accelerators for Texas Mutual contract.
Careful monitoring of these APIs will be done to understand Kong behaviors and used to operationalize the use of Kong for all legacy APIs.
This effort will be used to establish the standards for routing all legacy APIs via Kong.
