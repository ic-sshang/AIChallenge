Today we are using Azure DevOps for our CI/CD platform.  We are starting to look at other systems in this space for improved delivery.
Below is a list of requirements, pain points, questions, and wants as it relates to a CI/CD system and our current processes.
PAIN: Unable to easily see what version of software is deployed to deployment targets.
PAIN: There are too many pipelines.  Pipelines and artifacts have to be filtered/noise.  Side effect of having all code repositories under one ADO project and not being able to delete pipelines due to auditing requirements.
WANT:  Group deployments by a release.  Being able to action all or some of the deployments in the release group.
QUESTION: What is our data retention policy for deployment history.  What is our SLA for compliance on deployment auditing (SOC, PCI, etc…).
WANT: Decouple the audit history from the CI/CD system for portability and maintainability.
