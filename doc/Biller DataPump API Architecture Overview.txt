Introduction
The .NET 8 Web API application designed to have multiple endpoints related with retrieving DataPump related Data and handling the DataPump management settings.
One of the endpoints is to provide metrics for graphical representations in the Biller Portal. It retrieves DataPump metrics
In its current form, the API exposes a foundational endpoint:
GET /biller/biller-data-pump/metrics/{billerId}
This endpoint returns key performance metrics such as:
Average Response Time
Error Rate Percentage
Timeout Error Rate
These metrics help billers proactively monitor and address performance issues in their APIs.
🛠️ Future Capabilities
In upcoming phases, the API will be extended to support 
command-based operations
 for managing Datapump configurations and settings. This will include:
Creating, updating, and deleting Datapump thresholds.
Enabling or disabling alerting for specific billers.
Managing notification preferences and escalation rules.
These enhancements will transform the API into a comprehensive 
Datapump Monitoring and Management Platform
.
 Running the API
The API is designed to be containerized and deployed in a Kubernetes environment. It follows standard .NET configuration practices using 
Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration
. Configuration values can be provided in the following order of precedence:
appsettings.json
Environment variables
Operational Details 
1. 
Receive Request
The API receives a GET request with a 
billerId
 as a path parameter.
2. 
Fetch Metrics
In future phases, the API will query the performance logging database to retrieve metrics for the specified biller.
3. 
Return Response
The API will return a structured JSON response containing the requested metrics.
4. 
Error Handling
Proper error responses will be returned for invalid or missing 
bill
 Containerization & Deployment
A 
Dockerfile
 is included to build the API image.
Kubernetes manifests (
deployment.yaml
, 
service.yaml
) are provided as boilerplate for deploying the API to a Kubernetes cluster.
Health and readiness probes are stubbed for future configuration.
