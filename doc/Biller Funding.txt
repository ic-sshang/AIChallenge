Summary
This page explains how InvoiceCloud manages funding and payouts for billers across different payment methods. For 
Online Bank Direct (OBD)
 transactions, funds flow through Mastercard RPPS and Fiserv into Cass Bank, after which InvoiceCloud generates and transmits NACHA files to release biller payments. For 
PayPal/Braintree
, payments are stored in a Hyperwallet account and released via OneBatchExport files. For 
other vendors
 such as Chase and Sage, payouts are typically handled directly by the vendors, either on demand via InvoiceCloud API calls or on scheduled cycles. The document also outlines the scheduled 
funding jobs
 that support the OBD payout process.
