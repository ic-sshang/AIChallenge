Timeline and EA Group
Early Access starts in mid-November, followed by a General Availability release on December 13th.
A select group of billers will participate in the EA phase. (NFG, City of Clarksville Gas & Water Department, SEMCO 
, Safety Insurance, Georgia Farm Bureau, City of Chandler, City of Portland Oregon)
This group will have the opportunity to provide actionable feedback during the several weeks preceding the GA release.
Feature Control and Access
Access will be managed via a backend feature flag for incremental rollout.
IC Support users will gain early access for internal testing before the EA phase begins.
User Roles and Customization
Five default roles will be established: Super Admin, Admin, CSR, Finance, and IT.
These roles will feature a curated set of permissions aimed to serve the most common use-cases. However, we acknowledge the varied needs across our biller base, hence the flexibility for customization.
Billers retain the flexibility to customize these permissions and can also create or edit roles as per their specific needs.

 Business Logic
Business Logic (click to expand)
Role Management:
Admins can create new roles, edit existing roles (including the permissions tied to them), and delete roles in the biller portal. However, they cannot delete a role that is in use. If they try, they'll see an error message. Each role requires a unique name.
Role Permissions:
When creating or editing a role, admins can add one or more permissions (organized in categories). Check the confluence page for the full list of permissions. Search and filter for permissions is not necessary.
Assigning Roles to Users:
Admins can easily give a role to a user in the biller portal. Users can have only one role at a time If they get a new role, it'll replace the old one.
Extra Permissions for Users:
Admins can give users additional permissions to what their role grants. These extra permissions won't affect their assigned role. When choosing permissions, the role-based ones will be grayed out and can't be changed. Admins will also have the option to save a set of permissions as a new role.
User Interface and Experience:
The User Management submenu will have links to the Manage Users, Manage Roles, and Permission Audit Log pages. The look and feel of the Roles and Permissions feature should match the existing biller portal design. Pop-up notices will let users know when actions are successful (like creating, saving, or deleting roles).
Access and Auditing:
The system will make sure only authorized admins can manage roles and permissions. It'll also keep track of changes made to roles and permissions (such as who made the change, what was changed, and when), including a report that supports filtering and searching.
 Problem Alignment
Problem Alignment (click to expand)
Today, billers struggle to limit and track the actions of their staff in the Biller Portal. They need better control over permissions and some way to track them in order to meet security and auditing requirements, both inside and outside the organization. Currently, they sometimes have to grant or deny permissions too broadly, which can be a liability.
Imagine an admin who wants customer service reps to process only 
debit
 transactions, but not 
credit 
ones. Today it's just one permission, so blocking credit transactions means blocking debit transactions too. Not only do they have to clean up any mistakes, but this could even lead to legal problems in some places.
Here's another example: A city manages tax payments and parking tickets in their system. They want parking attendants to access and act on Parking Ticket invoice types only, without giving them access to Personal Property Tax and Real Estate Tax records. This isn’t possible today, so the parking attendant has to rely on a portal user to get information or take action. Their only alternative is to give the attendant access to restricted information that they shouldn’t see.
And lastly, consider how time-consuming it is to manually set permissions for each user (especially when you have 350+ like NFG). It would be much easier to just assign a role with pre-defined permissions one time, then select the users in that role. This would also make it quick and easy to manage any changes in permission that might occur.
 Objective
Objective (click to expand)
Provide audit trail of permission changes for billers to meet auditing and security requirements.
Implement a granular permission system that allows billers to limit and manage actions taken by their staff based on specific user roles.
Address specific permission-related issues, such as:
Allowing admins to grant permission for processing debit transactions, while preventing the processing of credit transactions.
(Phase 2) Enabling cities to manage access to specific invoice types (e.g., parking ticket invoices) while restricting access to others (e.g., Personal Property Tax and Real Estate Tax records).
Streamline the permission-setting process by allowing the assignment of pre-defined roles with associated permissions to users, rather than manual setting of permissions for each user.
Enhance the ease of managing changes to permissions for specific users or roles within an organization.

Impact
Biller Administrators
Biller administrators are responsible for managing permissions and access control for their staff in the Biller Portal. Enhancements to permission granularity, role-based access, and streamlined processes will directly impact their ability to effectively manage permissions and ensure compliance with auditing and security requirements.
Customer Service Representatives (CSRs)
CSRs interact with customers and process transactions in the Biller Portal. Improved permission management will ensure that CSRs have appropriate access to perform their tasks (e.g., processing debit transactions) while preventing unauthorized actions (e.g., processing credit transactions). This will enhance operational efficiency and reduce the risk of errors.
Finance and Compliance Teams
Finance and compliance teams within billing organizations oversee financial transactions and compliance with legal and security requirements. Granular permission management and improved auditing capabilities in the Biller Portal will enable these teams to better monitor and ensure compliance, reducing the risk of legal and compliance issues.
Support Team
Support teams handle technical issues and support requests from billers and their staff. A reduction in permission-related support tickets and improved permission management features will allow support teams to allocate their resources more effectively and address other needs of the organization.

UI Approach
We'll be giving the Biller Portal an upgrade with better permission management features. We'll enhance the existing UI and add some new elements. Our goal is to make it easier for admins to work with the new role-based access control, new permissions, and customizable access rights for different transactions and invoice types (Phase 2).
Deliverables
Mockups:
 We'll create high-fidelity mockups to show the new design and layout of the permission management pages and UI elements. We'll include screens like permission configuration, role assignment, permission review, and a permission audit log.
Flow Diagrams:
 We'll put together flow diagrams to show how users and admins will interact with the permission management system, including the onboarding process for new billers. This will help everyone understand the steps involved.
Interactive Prototypes:
 To make sure our design is intuitive, we'll create interactive prototypes for stakeholders to play around with and give feedback on.
User Guides and Documentation:
 We'll write up user guides and documentation that explain how to use the new permission management features. These will offer step-by-step instructions for admins and users on how to make the most of the improved functionality.
Usability Testing:
 We'll conduct usability tests with a small group of users and admins to gather feedback on the new UI design and functionality. Their insights will help us fine-tune the design before we roll it out.
 Components Impacted
Components Impacted (click to expand)
Component
Impact
Biller Portal
Will introduce a granular permission system with role-based access control, allowing admins to define and assign specific permissions based on user roles. This includes the ability to differentiate permissions for specific transaction types (e.g., debit vs. credit) and invoice types (e.g., Parking Ticket vs. Personal Property Tax).
User Management
Will add new pages and UI elements to the Biller Portal for configuring and managing permissions. This includes options for creating pre-defined roles with associated permissions, assigning roles to users, and customizing permissions for specific transaction and invoice types.
Audit Logging and Reporting
Will enhance audit logging capabilities to capture and track granular permission changes and user actions. This includes logging of permission assignments, updates to roles, and specific actions taken by users based on their permissions. New reporting options will be added to allow admins to review and export audit logs for compliance purposes.
User Onboarding Workflow
Will update the user onboarding workflow to integrate role-based permission assignments. Admins will be able to select pre-defined roles during the onboarding process, streamlining the setup of permissions for new users and reducing onboarding time.
Access Control Layer
Will implement updates to the access control layer to enforce granular permissions based on user roles. This includes ensuring that users can only perform actions they are authorized to do and restricting access to specific invoice types and transaction types based on their assigned permissions.
 Technical Architecture

User Interface (UI) - Permission Management:
This component includes the user interface pages and elements used by admins to configure and manage permissions, roles, and access rights for users.
Permission Management System:
This is the back-end system responsible for storing and managing permission configurations, user roles, and access rights. It interacts with the UI and the Access Control Layer.
Access Control Layer:
The Access Control Layer is responsible for enforcing permissions and access rights based on user roles. It ensures that users only have access to features, data, and actions they are authorized to perform.
Audit Logging and Reporting:
This component captures and tracks permission changes and user actions for auditing purposes. It generates logs and reports that can be reviewed and exported by admins.
User Onboarding Workflow:
The User Onboarding Workflow is the process through which new users are added to the Biller Portal. It includes the assignment of pre-defined roles and permissions during onboarding.
Data Store:
The Data Store is the database where information about permissions, roles, users, and audit logs is stored.
 Data Flow
Data Flow (click to expand)
When an admin configures permissions or roles through the UI, the changes are sent to the Permission Management System.
The Permission Management System processes the changes and updates the Data Store accordingly.
When a user logs in and attempts to access a feature or perform an action, the Access Control Layer verifies the user's permissions and role against the configurations stored in the Data Store.
If the user is authorized, access is granted, and the user's action is logged by the Audit Logging and Reporting component.
If the user is not authorized, access is denied, and the user’s action is logged by the Audit Logging and Reporting component.

Roles Management:
Admins should be able to create new roles in the biller portal.
Admins should also be able to edit existing roles, including changing the permissions tied to them.
Admins can delete roles, but only if no one is using that role. If they try to delete an in-use role, they'll see an error message.
Every role must have a unique name in the system.
Assigning Permissions to Roles:
When creating or tweaking a role, admins can add one or more permissions, sorted by categories.
A full list of permissions, organized by categories, is available (check the confluence page).
There's no need for search or filter features in the Permissions section.
User Role Assignment:
a.	Admins can easily assign a role to a user in the biller portal.
b.	Users can have just one role at a time. If they get a new role, it replaces the old one.
Extra Permissions for Users:
a.	Admins can give users more permissions than what their role provides.
b.	Role-related permissions should be grayed out and unchangeable in the Permissions section.
c.	Admins can save the selected set of permissions as a new role and give it a name.
User Interface and Experience:
a.	The User Management submenu should have links to Manage Users, Manage Roles, and the Permission Audit Log page.
b.	The design for the Roles and Permissions feature should match the current biller portal look.
c.	Pop-up notices will let users know when they've successfully completed actions, like creating, saving, or deleting roles and permissions.
d.	Mobile support isn't necessary for this feature.
Access and Auditing:
a.	The system will ensure only authorized admins can manage roles and permissions.
b.	It'll also keep a log of changes made to roles and permissions (who, what, and when), with support for filtering and searching.

Team/Product
Notes
User Interface (UI) Design
User Experience (UX) Design Team
We'll need the UX Design Team to create the UI design for our new permission management features (like configuring and managing permissions, roles, and access rights). Working closely with the UX team will help us make the interface easy to use and understand.
 Database Schema Update
Database Administration (DBA) Team
We might need to make some changes to the database schema so that it can handle the new permission configurations, user roles, and access rights. This is crucial for implementing and testing these updates.
 User Onboarding Workflow Update
Implementation Team
We'll need to update the user onboarding workflow to include role-based permission assignments. This way, new users can enjoy a smooth onboarding experience.
Documentation and Training Materials
Training Team
We’ll create documentation and training materials for the new permission management features. We'll need user guides, admin manuals, and training modules for both our internal staff and billers.
 Assumptions
Assumptions (click to expand)
Users
Admins in billing organizations are expected to have a basic grasp of permissions and roles, as well as experience managing access rights for their staff.
Biller Portal users, such as Customer Service Representatives and Parking Attendants, might have different job duties that call for varying levels of access to the portal's features and data.
User satisfaction and retention are influenced by the permission management system's ease of use, efficiency, and security.
Technical Constraints
The current architecture and database structure of the Biller Portal can handle the updates needed for the granular permission system and role-based access control.
The development and testing environments are equipped with the necessary tools and resources to support the implementation and testing of the new permission management features.
System performance and scalability shouldn't be significantly affected by the new permission management system.
Business Goals
Enhancing the permission management system is in line with the business goals of boosting security, compliance, and user satisfaction in the Biller Portal.
Streamlining user onboarding and reducing support tickets related to permission issues are crucial for improving operational efficiency.
Offering granular permissions and role-based access control could give us a competitive edge and attract more billers to the portal.
Legal and Compliance Considerations
The revamped permission management system should adhere to all relevant legal, regulatory, and industry standards for data privacy and security.
Providing audit logs and reports for permission changes and user actions is essential for meeting auditing requirements.

Question

Answer
Date Answered
How do we handle the transition from individual permissions to roles without causing confusion or unintended changes in permissions?
How do we avoid unnecessary complexity on the technical side?
Do we force all users to have a role or allow individual permissions without a role?
 
 
Implement an '
unassigned
' role (or '
none
'). Logic:
All new and existing users begin with the ‘
Unassigned’ 
role.
Users keep their current permissions (overrides/exceptions).
‘Unassigned’ 
role has 
no permissions
 associated with it.
‘Unassigned’ 
role permissions can't be changed.
Assigning a role gives the user its permissions.
When changing user role, show optional checkmark (default off) for "Keep user’s 
X
 existing permissions"
If left unchecked, the user only gets the permissions associated with the new role.
This simplifies switching roles.
Removing a role changes the user’s role to ‘
Unassigned’ 
/ ‘
None’.
