Secrets Overview
 
How do I leverage the Key Vault in a new or existing application?
To utilize the vault, please follow these steps:
Install the IC.Azure.KeyVault NuGet package from our private NuGet feed.
Add two appSetting keys to your configuration file (app.config/web.config)
xml
<appSettings>  
    <add key="ClientId" value="(ClientId)" />
    <add key="VaultName" value="(VaultName)" />
</appSettings>
When developing locally, the ClientId can be set to an empty string. This will be a tell to use the "Default" identity for the account loaded on to the machine.
This will be the same account the developer used to authenticate with Visual Studio.
When developing locally, please update the VaultName to be one of the two available Vaults. 
NOTE:
 The production vault will not work on the test term servers, and vice versa, the devtest vault will not work on the bastion term servers. 
Utilizing the KeyVault:
 5.a. 
Easy Method
:
Install the IC.Database.Authentication NuGet Package 
Create a new instance of the DatabaseKeyVaultReader type.
Utilize the GetSecret method to retrieve a secret.                 
vb
dim vault as IKeyVaultReader = new IC.Database.Authentication.DatabaseKeyVaultReader(ClientId, VaultName)
dim mySuperSecretSecret as String = vault.GetSecret("SuperSecretValue")
 5.b. 
Fancy Method
:   
Create a class to house the logic to retrieve the secrets.
vb
    Imports IC.Azure.KeyVault
    Imports IC.Interfaces
    Public Class KeyVaultClient
        Private Shared _instance As KeyVaultClient = Nothing
        Private Property azureKeyVaultClient As IKeyVaultReader
    
        Private Sub New(clientId As String, vaultName As String)
    
            ' If there is no clientId use DefaultIdentity else use ManagedIdentities
            If String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(clientId) Then
                azureKeyVaultClient = KeyVaultReader.CreateFromDefaultIdentity(vaultName)
            Else
                azureKeyVaultClient = KeyVaultReader.CreateFromManagedIdentity(vaultName, clientId)
            End If
        End Sub
    
        Public Shared ReadOnly Property Instance() As KeyVaultClient
            Get
                If _instance Is Nothing Then
                    ' Create instance with values from app.config 
                    Dim clientId As String = System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.AppSettings("ClientId")
                    Dim vaultName As String = System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.AppSettings("VaultName")
    
                    _instance = New KeyVaultClient(clientId, vaultName)
                End If
                Return _instance
            End Get
        End Property
    
        Public Function GetKeyVault() As IKeyVaultReader
            Return azureKeyVaultClient
        End Function
    End Class
Build the application, and enjoy.
