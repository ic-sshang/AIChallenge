Summary
The RVS integration is a batch integration (Stratus) utilizing EBPP and IVR for Utility.
The RVS integration was designed to be a standard integration. However, due to issues with how the first biller (Cleveland MS) is using Name/Address fields, the invoice file mapping is now considered ‘custom’.  
See 
RVS - City of Cleveland 1870 - Technical Design
 for more details.
When there are more RVS biller implementations to work through, the invoice file mapping will be reviewed for documentation of a ‘standard’ integration. All other integration details are considered ‘standard’ at this time.
