Mean Time To Resolve (MTTR)
April 2025 had a high MTTR of 7.3 days
, indicating longer resolution times at the start of the period.
May 2025 showed significant improvement
, with MTTR dropping to 4.9 days and improving by 32.9%.
The MTTR increased by approximately 
24.5%
 from May to June 2025. 
June 2025 saw a rise to 6.1 days
, suggesting a partial regression in resolution efficiency.
Improvements:
Improve ticket triage by prioritizing critical issues to reduce resolution delays.
Enhance Knowledge Base and Documentation.
Maintain a well-organized internal knowledge base with solutions to common issues.
Encourage support engineers to document fixes after resolving tickets.
Review high-MTTR tickets monthly to identify bottlenecks or training needs.
Current Backlog Health
Summary:
Backlog Size and Growth Rate
Backlog size is 11 ticket
Our Growth Rate seems to have increased in the last two months 
Issue Type breakdowns

Routing Efficiency 
Low Bounce Back
We route to the product team as quickly as we discover the product defects
Impact and Priority Balance
Escalations take first priority, and we handle them with thorough research.
We appreciate our team members who are available and lend a helping hand
Feedback Loop Health
Team BMS responds promptly to the issues we bring to their attention.
Internal vs External Visibility
Our product team and CS team members provide updates and track issues throughout the entire process.
Risks & Recommendations
How can we implement automated response over common troubled areas to confirm that the product are having issues rather than intended functionality or Product Requests.
