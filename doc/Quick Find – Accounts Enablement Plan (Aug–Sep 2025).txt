Eng Lead:
 Byron King and Sean Concanon
Design:
 Angela Lee
Target Pilot Enablement:
 
Aug 20, 2025
 (≈5-10 billers)
Phase 2 (Payments search):
 
Sep 3, 2025
 (target)
Phase 3 (Invoice search):
 
Sep 17, 2025
 (target)
Repo:
 BillerSearchAPI
Context:
 A recent change to the release process (Tue/Thu schedule, holiday impact, shared-repo merge constraints) may shift specific deployment windows. Dates below assume current targets and will be adjusted if platform release availability changes.
1) Objectives
Speed:
 Enable users to find an account from any page in ~1–3 seconds.
Adoption:
 Replace “Search Customers” legacy flow for ≥50% of lookups in pilot billers within 30 days.
Success Rate:
 ≥70% “search attempts” (clicking into search box) end with a result click.
Time Savings:
 Show aggregate time saved vs. legacy flow and report at 30/60/90 days.
2) Scope (this plan)
In scope (Phase 1 – Accounts):
Search by: account number, display account number, customer name, email address.
Result list (≤8 items), keyboard navigation, clear “no results” state.
Open customer profile in existing tab.
API auth, error handling & retry logic; performance optimizations; sorting equally matching results.
Feature-flagged enablement by biller.
Out of scope (for Phase 1):
Payment and Invoice search (covered in Phase 2/3 below).
Address search (planned later).
Full-page advanced search parity.
3) Rollout Strategy & Timeline
Key principle:
 Gradual, instrumented rollout using a feature flag; proceed when metrics meet thresholds.
Phase
Window
Who
Enablement
Key Activities
Exit / Go-No-Go
Internal Validation
Aug 12–16
Internal Support & PM/QA
Flag = on for internal tenants only
Scenario testing; performance baselines; refine copy/empty states; keyboard a11y
No P0/P1 defects open
Pilot (≈5-10 billers)
Aug 20–23
Handpicked mix (size/industry)
Flag = on by biller
Pendo pop-up with GIF; CSM heads-up; daily checks; hotfix readiness
≥80% success rate; manageable feedback
Controlled Expansion
Aug 25–29
+50–200 billers (batch)
Flag on in batches
Monitor dashboards per batch; message cadence in Pendo
Same thresholds hold for each batch
GA (All billers)
Aug 29–Sep 2
All remaining billers
Flag = on for all
Org-wide comms; retire legacy page entry points (kept as fallback link)
Adoption ≥70% vs. legacy; stable perf
Phase 2: Payments Search
Target Sep 3
Pilot → GA
Separate flag(s)
Same measurement model and comms pattern
Go when Accounts stable
Phase 3: Invoice Search
Target Sep 17
Pilot → GA
Separate flag(s)
Same measurement model and comms pattern
Go when Payments stable
Dependencies / Risks impacting dates:
 shared-repo merge windows, release freeze/holiday, infra capacity. Contingency: maintain pilot for +1 week if GA window slips.
4) Pilot Biller Selection
5 billers recommended: 
small/medium/large mix
, varied verticals.
Pre-identified via CSM nominations: 2613 NFG, 189 Mishawaka Utilities, 1885 Truckee Meadows, 836 Portland OR, 2944 Hawaii Gas
Include at least 1 known 
heavy user
 of legacy search and 1 
low-adoption
 customer to compare behavioral shifts.
Confirm data volume & indexing status ahead of enablement.
5) Feature Flag & Configuration
Flag Name:
 [feature flag name].
Targeting:
 billerId allow-list; additionally gate per user role if needed.
Default:
 Off.
Rollout:
 Enable in batches; keep kill-switch available at tenant or global scope.
Config params:
 resultLimit=8; debounceMs=[200]; throttleMs=[250]; minChars=[1].
6) Instrumentation, Monitoring, and KPIs
Tools:
 Pendo (UI events), New Relic (APM & logs), [Elasticsearch/Index monitoring], [BI dashboard URL].
6.1 Event Model (Pendo/UI)
qf_focus
 — user focuses the quick-find input (captures page, billerId, userId, role).
qf_results_shown
 — results list rendered (captures count, timeToFirstResultMs).
qf_no_results
 — zero results state displayed.
qf_result_click
 — user clicks a result (captures position/index, accountId).
qf_blur
 — input loses focus (captures dwellMs since focus).
qf_cancel
 — user closes/escapes.
legacy_search_nav_click
 — navigates to legacy Search Customers page.
legacy_search_submit
 — submits a legacy search.
Attempt grouping:
Define a 
Search Attempt
 from 
qf_focus
 → (first of 
qf_result_click
 
or
 
qf_blur
 + 5s inactivity window).
Record 
finalQuery
 = last query string at attempt end (mask PII in analytics as needed).
Outcomes
: Success (result click), Glance (results shown, no click), Fail (no results), Abandon (blur w/out results).
6.2 API/Backend Metrics (New Relic)
P95/P99 latency; error rate; timeouts; retries; throughput; top queries; zero-results rate; index health (lag/size); DB load.
Log correlation id: include 
attemptId
 from UI to tie UI↔API.
6.3 KPIs & Targets
Adoption
: % of lookups via Quick Find vs. legacy (goal: ≥70% within 30 days of GA).
Search Success Rate
: Success attempts / total attempts (goal: ≥80%).
Time to Result (UI)
: median ≤1s, P95 ≤2.5s.
API Latency (P95)
: ≤700 ms.
Error Rate
: ≤0.5% (4xx/5xx combined; 5xx ≤0.2%).
Zero-Results Rate
: baseline + trend; investigate if >10% for any biller.
Legacy Displacement
: legacy page usage down ≥50% by day 30 in pilot.
6.4 Time-Savings Calculation (for LT/Board)
Legacy path time (avg):
 
T_legacy
 = avg time from nav to legacy search → result click (add +2–3s for page navigation).
Quick Find time (avg):
 
T_qf
 = avg time from 
qf_focus
 → 
qf_result_click
.
Savings per successful attempt:
 
ΔT = T_legacy – T_qf
.
Monthly aggregate savings:
 
Σ(ΔT * attempts_migrated)
, where 
attempts_migrated ≈ qf_successes
 and cross-check with decline in legacy submits.
Report at 
30/60/90 days
 with biller-level highlights.
6.5 Dashboards & Alerts
Dashboards:
 [Pendo dashboard URL], [New Relic dashboards URL], [Index health URL].
Alerts:
P95 latency >700 ms for 15 min (warn), >1,200 ms (critical).
Error rate >0.5% for 15 min (warn), >1.5% (critical).
Zero-results rate spike: +50% vs. 7-day baseline.
Legacy displacement stagnates (<20% drop by day 14 in pilot).
7) UX & Content (Phase 1)
Result list:
 8 max; acct #, name, email snippet; highlight matches; keyboard up/down + Enter.
Empty state copy:
 “No matches. Try full account number, email, or name.”
Error state:
 “Search temporarily unavailable. Try again in a moment or use Search Customers.”
Accessibility:
 proper labels, role=listbox, aria-activedescendant, visible focus, 44px tap targets.
8) Communications & Training
8.1 Internal (Support, CSM, Sales, Training, LT)
Aug 13–15
: Share plan + pilot list; provide 1‑pager + 30‑sec GIF; enable feedback route.
Channels:
 Email + Slack #[unknown channel]; Confluence page: [unknown link].
Weekly updates:
 pilot metrics snapshot & top feedback.
Internal email (template):
Subject:
 Quick Find (Accounts) — Pilot starting Aug 20
We’re enabling Quick Find for ~10 billers on Aug 20. It surfaces accounts from any page in seconds. Goals: ≥80% success, ≥70% adoption vs. legacy within 30 days. See enablement pack: [link]. Please route feedback via [Jira project link] or Slack #[channel].
8.2 Pilot Biller Outreach (CSM‑led)
Option A (heads‑up):
 email on Aug 16–19; enable Aug 20.
Option B (silent enable + in‑app):
 flip on Aug 20 + Pendo pop-up.
Biller email (template):
Subject:
 Early Access: Quick Find for faster account lookup
We’ve enabled a new search box at the top of the Biller Portal that finds accounts instantly by name, account #, or email. No setup needed. Please try it and share feedback here: [Pendo link] or contact your CSM.
8.3 In‑App (Pendo)
Pop‑up (pilot → GA):
 title “New: Quick Find from any page”; 2‑line description + 30‑sec GIF; CTA buttons: “Try it” (focus input) / “Tell us what you think”.
Tooltip:
 persistent dot on header search for first 3 logins.
9) QA / UAT Readiness
Functional:
 partial/whole tokens; order‑independent terms; whitespace/diacritics; casing; special chars; long strings; throttling/debounce; top‑N; sort ties.
Performance:
 large tenants; cold/warm cache; error/retry paths.
Navigation:
 open in same tab; back behavior; deep link correctness.
Security:
 auth on API; rate limiting; input validation; log scrubbing of PII in analytics.
A11y/UX:
 keyboard only; screen reader; high contrast; focus trap.
Cross‑env:
 Chrome/Edge/Firefox, responsive breakpoints.
Exit for pilot:
 No open P0/P1; P95 latency ≤700 ms; instrumentation verified end‑to‑end.
10) Risks & Mitigations
Risk
Impact
Mitigation
Release/merge freeze in shared repo
Date slips
Maintain pilot for +1 week; pre‑stage code; coordinate with Eng release owners
Index growth/lag
Slow results
Monitor index health; add capacity; limit fields; tune analyzers
High zero‑results rate for certain billers
Frustration
Add synonyms/normalization; CSM outreach; analyze query patterns
PII in analytics
Compliance
Mask tokens; truncate; retention ≤30 days; access controls
Over‑counting searches (type‑as‑you‑go)
Misleading KPIs
Attempt grouping model; success defined as result click
UX confusion w/ legacy page
Split usage
Pendo nudge; reduce prominence of legacy; add “Didn’t find it? Use advanced search” link
11) Rollback Plan
Triggers:
 critical perf regression, >1.5% error rate sustained, security incident, major functional bug.
Mechanism:
 disable feature flag by biller or globally.
Comms:
 post to #[incident channel]; notify CSMs for impacted billers; add banner if widespread.

Dependencies:
 confirm searchable fields; index readiness; security review for payment tokens/PII.
Dates:
 Payments target 
Sep 3
; Invoices target 
Sep 17
; each may slip if prior phase not yet at stability thresholds.
