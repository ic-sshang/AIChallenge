Previous 2025 Planning
Note, not sure if anything from either the Short List or Long List will get into 2025, definitely not in 2025 Q1 and unlikely in 2025 Q2 as we had lots of carry over or things moved into 2025 from 2024.

Big rocks that we need to start - or they will never get done
Long 2025 Wish List
lower environment parity
including PaaS services
containerize VM-based workloads
or PaaS i.e. functions - get off VM’s
VM scale sets as an intermediate step
too much to do in 1 year. break into two targets
1. containerize proxy services (already made headway) and ICGateway only
2. (later) do the same for web and Skybot apps
do a cost-analysis on this project
how much money can we save (runtime, human resources, ease of deployment + operations, etc.) by making this transition?
sell DR – it’d take DAYS to get back online with today’s infra
local development
no more non-prod AVD; prod still uses AVD as jump box
migrate all resources out of ‘Primary-Subscription’ into their proper subscriptions
move regression into non-prod
create true non-prod hub + make sandbox a real sandbox
improve Palo Alto configuration (ansible???)
establish awx - use ansible to do VM configs, updates, etc (starting before 2025)
move from Alien Vault to Azure Sentinel (starting before 2025)
improve Warp VPN configuration
create build pipelines
run in Kubernetes rather than ACI
implement observability (
platform observability epic link here
)
nuget package (library) management
ability to approve specific 3rd party packages for usage in production
license review of 3rd party components
process to version, test, and promote internal packages to production-ready status
DR
Azure Site Recovery is kinda configured - revisit this configuration
validate the plan + run some exercises 
improve/create a true and tested DR strategy
resource cleanup + documentation + ownership assignment
what’s all that stuff in west?
cleanup environments
clear out dead IIS configs
know what apps run on what servers, and what our software catalog is (
CMDB
)
delete unused PaaS services
delete dead Skybot jobs
DNS cleanup
rename test/staging resources to prod
resize Redis + create appropriate Redis instances for MyIIS, ICCRM, and BillerPortal
private endpoints for PaaS services
lock down public access
get platform data into snowflake + analyze
azure devops - i.e. which pipelines run, how frequently, when did deployment happen, who approved them, etc
long-term system performance + trends (summarizing new relic - retention is between 30d and 1y there)
Cloudflare CDN 
especially for static content
IAM and Access Review (Azure subscriptions)
establish proper roles
with PIM (no admin accounts!)
component version management
ensure Windows servers aren’t EOL (no 2012 etc.)
ensure Warp image is running up-to-date version of app, etc
create plans to ensure we’re staying updated with our platform components
CMDB of platform components
ensure k8s versions are current etc
