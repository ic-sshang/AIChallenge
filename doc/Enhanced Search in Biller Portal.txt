The Problem
Billers using our Biller Portal often need to search for specific accounts, invoices, or payments. Currently, they have to navigate through different sections of the portal to find this information, which can be time-consuming and frustrating.
Why: How do we know this is a real problem and worth solving?
Based on feedback and support tickets, we know that billers struggle with finding specific information quickly. The lack of a central search function would address the common problem of navigating to multiple reports to find the requested information.
Audience: Who are we building for?
We are building this for our biller portal users. This feature will be beneficial for all billers, regardless of their technical proficiency or familiarity with our system, as well as our internal support team.
High-level Approach
By integrating a comprehensive search bar in the Biller portal, we aim to streamline the process of finding specific accounts, invoices, or payments. This search bar will update results as the user is typing.
Success
How do we know if we’ve solved this problem?
We will know we have succeeded if we see a decrease in support tickets related to finding specific information and an increase in user satisfaction scores.
Metrics to track:
Decrease in support tickets related to finding specific information
Increase in user satisfaction scores
Increase in usage of the search bar feature
