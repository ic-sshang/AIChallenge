Description
This is a .NET Worker Service deployed in the

 Kubernetes cluster.
Its primary function is to read unprocessed

The service manages authentication by calling the centralized authentication service to obtain a token, using the appropriate authentication type for the request.
After receiving the Biller API’s response, it updates the corresponding 
datapump
 record in the relevant Biller shard.
Scaling
 is handled by 
KEDA
, based on the number of messages pending in the Service Bus topic.
Primary Functionality
Processes datapump records and calls biller CIS API’s to notify the payment update.
