We finish ICPaymentProccessingAPI
We are getting faster
We completed 3 EPICS, for CloudMVEAPI, PayByTextService and ICPAymentProcessings
We had a couple of easy wins. Also, we could quickly identify False Positives and closed them. Burning down the backlog quickly. We are right on schedule for Q2 or a bit ahead.
Great momentum in getting things out the door.
We document tickets information better (description,test, priority,etc)
Testing is getting difficult coz sometimes we need to test in production AVD
Identifying test cases was little bit difficult for few of the stories.+1
Some deployment were postponed coz other projects
Improve ability to identify cross-functional dependencies and effectively address cross-functional blockers.
Be proactive about working on Sub-Tasks.
Once a baseline is identified for a solution, repeat it for other similar items in the EPIC.
From: Chrystian
To: all the team, for the spent effort on EPICS completion +3
Thanks to Raj for helping with automating CloudEmvAPI tests and identifying other xray tests for repos.
Once Mau comes back we all can go on vacation and hand it over to him.
