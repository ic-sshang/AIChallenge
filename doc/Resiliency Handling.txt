Polly
Polly is a .NET resilience and transient-fault-handling library that allows you to define policies such as retries, circuit breakers, and fallbacks.

Retry Policy
Transient faults are temporary issues that can occur in distributed systems, such as network timeouts, temporary unavailability of a service, or brief connectivity issues. Retry policies help handle these transient faults by retrying the operation after a short delay, increasing the chances of success.
This example demonstrates how to create a retry policy that retries an operation up to three times with a two-second delay between each retry.
c#
// Define the retry policy
var retryPolicy = Policy
    .Handle<HttpRequestException>()
    .WaitAndRetryAsync(3, retryAttempt => TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2), (exception, timeSpan, retryCount, context) =>
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Retry {retryCount} encountered an error: {exception.Message}. Waiting {timeSpan} before next retry.");
    });

// Execute the operation with the retry policy
await retryPolicy.ExecuteAsync(async () =>
{
    await MyExternalSystemHttpRequestAsync();
});
