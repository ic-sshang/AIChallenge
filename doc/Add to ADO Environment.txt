ADO Environment Excerpt
Web server must be added to its environment in Azure DevOps so that applications can be deployed to it
Note: 
if we only add to the ADO environment, and not to the legacy deployment group, legacy release definitions will no longer work; only YAML deployment pipelines would function. I believe that most if not all web apps have been updated to use YAML. I believe this could be a good way to ensure that no legacy release definitions are in use, but we need to finalize the decision as a team.
