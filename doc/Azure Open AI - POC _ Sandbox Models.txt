The below table lists model deployments that can be used for POC work with the Azure Open AI SDK or REST API.   Each model can be accessed via its endpoint, deployment name, version, and API key.   API keys are stored in the sandbox Azure Key Vault (
arch-kv-poc
).  You should be able to access the Key Vault secrets from your AVD in the Azure Portal using your developer account.  If you run into issues accessing the keys or models reach out to an architect for support.
Use these models for local development and POC work.   They must not be used outside of POCs.
