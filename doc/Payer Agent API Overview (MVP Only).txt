Get biller configuration
Currently it’s configured in IVR system
We have 
Retrieve Biller Status
 and 
Retrieve Biller Payment Types
, but neither returns everything we need, so we’ll need to revise Retrieve Biller Status, or add a new function.
Get customer details (incl. open invoices)
AdvancedIVRSearch
Add SOAP response params:
CustomerGUID
AccountNumber
Paperless enrollment status
Autopay enrollment status
EmailAddress
There’s no existing function to blindly get accounts.  The closest we have is 
Retrieve Open Invoices
 and similar.  Problem is this requires a customer guid.  We can get customer guid from 
Retrieve CustomerGUID
, but that requires an authentication token, which can be retrieve using 
Remote Authentication
, but that requires user/email and password, which we don’t have.  We may have to spin up a new function to return us a customer guid, using an account search similar to the web.
