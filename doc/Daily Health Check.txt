There are a few different types of health checks such as liveliness and readiness probes, to deeper ones such as canary requests to test the correctness of a business function in production.
Basic Health Checks:
All applications should at least have liveliness and readiness probes. For more information about them, see this document: 
Liveness and Readiness Probes
Who is testing?
Embedded SREs are responsible for monitoring the jobs during the workweek, and during the weekend the personnel on-call will monitor the jobs. Currently, we are running Health Checks for the following scrum teams:
Team SPAM
Wicked Tendies
Billing Me Softly 
What are we testing? 
The aim of a health check is to provide insight into the current “health” of your system.
Such as: 
Is the service running? Is the service able to communicate with its dependencies such as the database? If a queue is involved in asynchronous work, is the count staying close to 0? or is work stacking up?
Health checks should have as little impact on the system as possible. The lower the impact a check has, the more often it can be run without adding a noticeable load. The more often it can run, the more likely it will find issues before your customers.
The following functions are checked for the respective scrum teams:

When are we testing?
Team SPAM 
executes the SQL queries for Health Check once per workday at 8 AM.
 
Wicked Tendies'
 (WT) Health Check job runs automatically 3 times per work day at 9 AM, 12 PM, and 4:30 PM. These times are after critical jobs have finished processing.
Billing Me Softly
 runs the Health Check app manually once per workday at 8:30 AM. 
Next steps, when Health Check fails…
Team SPAM:
If the job fails the initial action is to send a message in 
#team-spam
 slack channel and review the logs. Depending on the issue, the team reconfigure settings or make an EBPP/DS item to resolve.
Wicked Tendies:
If the job fails the initial action is to send a message in 
#wt-health-check
 slack channel and review the logs.
After the log information is reviewed there are the steps:
Rerun the Health Check
If the Health Check is successful after the second attempt, no additional steps are required
If the rerun fails after the second run, create a DS item and inform the Wicked Tendies team that the issue is under review, and share the DS item. Consult and Escalate as per the criticality of the issue.
Billing Me Softly:
If the job fails the initial action is to send a message in 
#bms-billing-me-softly-scrumteam
 slack channel and review the logs.
For example, if a skybot job failed the team would carry further investigation to check what caused the failure. 
Then a DS item is created to address the issue.
