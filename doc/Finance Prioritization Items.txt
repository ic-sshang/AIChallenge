Residuals 
Would like to get a note/comment box added to the payment schedule records (commission & Residuals) that is visible from the Commissions/Residuals tab.
Intention: to add notes where non-contractual rates are being input so we have the documentation directly with the payment schedule

The go live date was incorrectly populating in our residual payment schedules in the case where we had entered a payment schedule but the live date was not yet populated.

Live Billers (manual)
Biller Pricing – Transactional Pricing Minimum’s for volume billers ( like how you can have minimums for service fees). Currently KFB is billed manually for this.

Live Billers (manual)
Tiered Pricing based on counts and/or volume

SOX Control
Along with the staging area we would like a  dropdown and comments box that would be used by teams to have a high level note on why the pricing change is being made (Dropdown: Contract Amendment, Pricing change, expanded invoice type, new payment method, others tbd) . 
7
SOX Control
A staging area for changes in rates or other invoice type changes. The changes would be entered by one individual, and would be placed in a pending stage until reviewed and approved by another boarding team member.

Potential Sale & expected to become a larger sales strategy
A hybrid pricing model: example: Submitter pays $3.95 per transaction, any single invoice transaction above a set threshold ($800) would be charged to the billers at a percentage (2.75% for any invoice amount over $800)
11/28/2023- Need to schedule meeting with Devs from BMS and WDIL to review

Ability to Tier Biller Portal Fees per year for example: Year 1 $500 Year 2 $400 Year 3 ( and on ) $250 – Currently a manual process to remember to email boarding to lower these prices yearly.

- No story created yet, waiting on a decision for a path forward with Braintree.  
Braintree
Braintree
Currently CRM is set up to run billing in one consolidated batch job without the ability to toggle off certain billers.  With Braintree cost data expected to come in day 5/6 of the month, we would want the ability to de-select certain billers from the batch job (i.e. to allow for cost data to be included in current month invoice) such that we are not holding up billing for all customers.

Enhancement to UI (CRM)
More simplified way to view pricing and any exceptions, instead of having to drop down into each invoicetype/paymentsource. For example Boston has so many invoicetypes and then add all the different payment sources it’s hard to review.
12
Enhancement to UI (CRM)
To piggyback off of the pricing request above, the ability to remove invoice types that are not needed on either transactional pricing or service fee tabs. I’ve notice that invoice types are populated on both and may cause confusion. If there isn’t any pricing then there should be option to remove it from view and declutter the page.

Dependent on Ross for obtaining reports during close
Ability to run some of our standard reports ourselves (residual & commission reports, CRM to Fin 10, others)

Time savings and automation for financially material process
Static table/warehouse for storing the accounting teams IC GAAP report and have this being used for residual calculations. This would eliminate the need for detailed reconciliations on a monthly basis.
15
Further Automation of residual process
Residual & Commissions calculations for COGS Model - This would include building in a standard percentage (can be adjusted quarterly) to discount our net residuals/commissions  by a standard rate for partners that have the COGS language.
