FAQ for billers
1​. Do you apply discounts to your customer's accounts? (For example, Lowell does "Prompt Pay Discount" as a special feature.)  
2​. Who owns the last bill? (Most Munis customer's policies are whoever owns the Account Number is responsible for what is owed at the time.  If biller wants the balance to stay with the specific owner (previous owner versus new owner), then we must incorporate CustomerID as part of the full account number on Invoice Cloud's side (format will be PropertyID-CustomerID = Account Number on Invoice Cloud's side) Fishers Sewer and Storm Water BIDs 957 and 958 and Kennebunk BID 190 are examples of this Account Number format used to keep the owed balances specific to the customer/owner type (previous vs. new owner)) 
 is there a certain file import type?  How is this achieved?
