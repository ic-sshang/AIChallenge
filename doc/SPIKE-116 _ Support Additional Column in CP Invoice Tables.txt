Description
: The proposal to add a 4th configurable column (“Past Due”) alongside the default “Invoice” column, making 5 columns total in customer invoices pages.
Technical Changes in 
ICCRM
:
Need to increase the index value from 3 to 4 for Grid constraint ‘Open Invoices’ at below page.
Updating max columns from 3 to 4.
After updating the code, the page looks like below, the 4rth configurable column got enabled for “Open Invoices, Closed Invoices and Recent Bill Listing” option.
CRM
:
Customer invoices pages: 
The Past Due columns got reflected as a 5
th
 column.
Open invoices:
Closed invoices:
Why the customer portal shows only based on 
open invoices
, 
closed invoices
, and 
recent bill listings 
selection in CRM because:
The front-end calls ICRESTAPI to get invoice data.
ICRESTAPI runs the stored procedure 
[bcg].[selCustomerGroupInvoiceLedger].
This procedure is 
hardcoded
 
with
 gridID = 9
, which is set to return 
only open invoices
, 
closed invoices
, and 
recent bill listings
So, the invoice data is filtered based on that fixed gridID which hardcode in the SP.
