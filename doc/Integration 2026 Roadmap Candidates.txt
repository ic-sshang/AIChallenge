Stratus File Processor (SFP) Scalability 
Single-Threaded File Processing
The current system operates in a single-threaded manner, 
where an influx of high volume from one biller is significantly delaying processing for multiple other billers.
 
where a raw file processing failure for one biller can impact others, leading to a cascading backlog across multiple file processing tasks. This architecture limits fault isolation and affects overall system throughput and reliability.
Micro services
Breakdown SFP
Breakdown BFS
Breaking down the existing SFP and BFS (into micro services) to make it more Re-Usability and improve the performance of the service.

Real Time Data Refresh (RTDR)
RTDR Modernization
RTDR Modernization
Each integration has it’s own error messaging and is not consistent. Also, it is difficult to identify the source of the error (on our end or the SPs end) without manual intervention from Engineering.
Meaningful 
and consistent 
error messaging in case of RTDR failure 
across all integrations

RTDR Implementation 
Implementation of RTDR 
for a new integration
 is not smooth and would require Integration engineer
Low code RTDR implementation
A self-serve model which 
SE/
IM/CS can create/manage RTDR implementation.
IMs or Solutions Engineering team will know the XML path for attributes to be referenced and update the IC systems, a mapping tool or mechanism will allow them to implement RTDR without coding (high level idea)

Capability for InvoiceCloud CS/IM to run the task remotely  
It will be helpful in running for delivering payment export in case of payment export job failure due to batch closure issues. 
As of today, Integration Engineers is involved to the process of re-delivery of the file.
Installer update
Building of the app version in use is done on specific machine (old machine with older dependencies), it is an Operational cost for the company for maintaining the machine.  
Auto Update
The current version is use is very old, and could be vulnerable
As an immediate step repo scans are needed to find any vulnerability and fix it. 
 
File Conversion (RAW to BIF Mapping)
 
Each time a new biller is onboarded, custom code implementation is required to map the biller's raw data file to the InvoiceCloud BIF (Biller Integration Format) specification. This requires coding effort, increases dependency on engineering resources.
SEs already create a mapping document that the developers use to convert RAW files to known file types.
A low-code solution could allow the SE to configure the file instead and reduce repeated work/effort from Engineering to support the new file.

Payment Export
High Dependency on Batch Closure:
The payment export process is tightly coupled with batch closing activities, making it vulnerable to any delays or failures in batch execution.
Lack of Retry Mechanism:
There is currently no automated retry process for payment exports in the event of batch failures (process in totality), which can lead to missed or delayed exports.
Limited Operational Flexibility During Incidents:
In major incident scenarios—such as failed batch closures or export failures—Client Services (CS) lacks the ability to re-run the export process independently and must rely on Integration Engineers for manual intervention.
Current process is Failure-Prone
The current process is vulnerable to failures during batch closure or database-level 
incidents
 export operations
, often requiring manual intervention.
Protentional Enhancements
Auto Re-run Logic:
Implement a rule where the payment export process automatically re-runs upon successful batch closure—regardless of whether it’s a regular or recovery scenario.
End-Stage Integration:
Redesign the process so that payment export becomes the final step of batch closure, ensuring completeness and reliability.
Event-Driven File Placement:
Shift from scheduled jobs to a file event-driven model for placing payment exports, improving responsiveness and reducing delays.
Recovery Functionality (Phased):
Introduce recovery capabilities:
Manual Healing:
 CS can trigger exports on demand via CRM or on behalf of billers (e.g., Stratus).
Auto Healing:
 System automatically re-runs failed exports without CS intervention.
PayFac Support
PayFac changes will impact batch closures and payment exports will need to be updated to support the new model.
Why This Initiative Matters
This is currently one of the most frequent 
incident
 
recovery
 categories.
Heavy dependency on batch closure 
timing
 forces Integration teams into the mitigation process.
Lack of UI or features for CS to re-run exports makes the process inefficient and not scalable.

PDF Linking 
Monitoring/Alerting
Lack of observability 
Poor user experience
Failures in PDF extraction can disrupt invoice linking, which directly impacts the automated notification workflow and delays payment reminders to customers/payers which can also be considered as late payments or no payments on InvoiceCloud platform. These issues often arise from uncommunicated changes to PDF templates that were baselined during implementation. 
Protentional Enhancements
Ensure Reliable Notification Workflow:
Prevent PDF extraction failures to maintain proper invoice-to-PDF linking and ensure uninterrupted dispatch of payment reminder emails.
Visual indicators in form of new feature or any other means to let biller portal users (or any other biller persona) know about unlinked invoices 
The biller portal currently has PDFMonitor and PDFHistory we will need to research what information or tools would benefit Billers.
Report on biller portal / CRM to let biller users and Client Services (CS) alerted about non linking on PDFs before the 1st email notification. 
The only info currently is in the Invoice File Search, which shows that pdfs are unlinked and won’t send email notifications, and the biller can manually force to send out notifications without PDFs. Information per invoice in the biller portal on why the notification was not sent.

PDF Extraction Enhancements
Impact of PDF Extraction Failures:
PDF extraction failures can prevent invoices from being linked to their corresponding pdf, disrupting the notification workflow and halting the dispatch of first, second, and third payment reminders to payers.
Template Change Without Notification:
These failures occur due to changes in the PDF template that was originally baselined during implementation, without InvoiceCloud being notified of the updates. 
Same point as last item on the initiative above.
Need for Marker Refactoring:
The current codebase includes a large number of legacy markers, many of which are no longer in use. There is no mechanism to identify active markers, resulting in inefficient processing as the system loops through all existing markers. This is the action 
Recommended Action:
Refactoring is needed to streamline marker usage, improve processing efficiency, and introduce a tracking mechanism for active markers to enhance maintainability and performance. 
Failures in PDF extraction can disrupt invoice linking, which directly impacts the automated notification workflow and delays payment reminders to customers/payers which can also be considered as late payments or no payments on InvoiceCloud platform. These issues often arise from uncommunicated changes to PDF templates that were baselined during implementation. Additionally, the presence of outdated markers and lack of visibility into active ones leads to inefficient processing and increased system load. Without proper refactoring and tracking, maintainability becomes challenging and the risk of recurring failures increases. Addressing these problems is essential to improve reliability, performance, and operational efficiency.
Protentional Enhancements
Leverage AI for Adaptive PDF Extraction:
Integrate AI-based extraction models that can dynamically adapt to changes in PDF templates, reducing manual intervention and improving resilience. 
This can be its own initiative
Ensure Reliable Notification Workflow:
Prevent PDF extraction failures to maintain proper invoice-to-PDF linking and ensure uninterrupted dispatch of payment reminder emails.
Visual indicators in form of new feature or any other means to let biller portal users (or any other biller persona) know about failed extractions. 
Report on biller portal / CRM to let biller users and Client Services (CS) alerted about extraction failure.
Establish Template Change Governance:
Implement a formal process for identifying and notifying InvoiceCloud of any changes to PDF templates post-implementation.
Refactor Marker Logic:
Clean up legacy markers in the codebase by removing unused entries and optimizing the logic to improve processing efficiency.
Introduce Marker Usage Tracking:
Develop a mechanism to identify and monitor active markers to support better maintainability and reduce technical debt.
Optimize Extraction Performance:
Streamline the extraction process by limiting operations to relevant markers, reducing unnecessary system load.

IC Template Literal Conversion & 
CRM Integration
Current effort. Not a 2026 roadmap candidate?
Many IC templates used for invoices have hardcoding, and if any change is required then it has to go via release process
Identify all the hard coding to literals and make save in database
Make all the literals update via CRM 
We want to work on this initiative because any time a new request is raised, Intergration team needs to be involved which requires team to 
Analyze the request
Code change and Raise DBR request
Code change has to go through release process 
The total cycle time is hug as it has to follow the whole SDLC process and involvement of integration team. 
If all the hardcoding is converted to literals and saved in database, and all are made configurable via CRM then
No release is needed 
No involvement of Integration engineer to code
A self-serve tool for CS/IM

Stratus File Processor (SFP)
The 'Stratus File Processor' is Invoice Cloud's proprietary system that normalizes the incoming invoice data and converts it to a standardized 'BIF' (Biller Invoice File) format. This allows Invoice Cloud to process invoice files in various formats like Excel, XML, or CSV from different billing systems, such as utilities, taxes, insurance, etc. The Stratus system takes the source files provided by the billing systems and converts them to the standardized BIF format, which makes the data easier to read and understand.

Real Time Data Refresh (RTDR) 
RTDR
RTDR - Real Time Data Refresh, is a very extensively used functionality to get a real-time data update from the Biller via web service calls. The primary purpose of RTDR was to refresh the customer data before it is accessed however it has evolved over a period of time and new functionality was added to RTDR.

 Payment Export 
export
Payment export is an InvoicCloud internal process it is a key part of batch close operations for billers using payment file exports. Upon batch closure, payment files are automatically generated, delivered via standard methods like FTP or Stratus, and stored in a centralized SharePoint folder. In case of delays or failures, IT or Client Services may manually generate or modify these files. Users can access and download exports through CRM, and files can also be attached to batch close notifications. Custom batch close timings in CRM help align exports with specific biller needs.

Why?
1
Payment Export
Highly dependent on batch closing activity
No retries of payment export process in case of batch failures
In case of major incidents when payment export failed or batch closure failed, CS cannot re-run the process and require Integration engineers to manage the exports
The current process is prone to failure is case of batch closure failure or export failure (at database level), current process can be enhanced to 
Rule of thumb: Auto re-run whenever batch closure is completed, irrespective of regular scenario or failure/recovery scenario
Make payment export to be an end stage of completion of batch closure
Make placement of file event drive (file event) rather than scheduled job driven
In case of incident or process failure, build a recovery functionality (in phases)
Manual healing: CS will run the job on demand from CRM and on behalf of biller (in case of stratus) 
Auto healing: System re-runs' the task on behalf of CS/biller user
Why should consider this initiative?
Currently this is the most frequent incident item.
Heavily dependent on batch closure, which forces the integration team to be part of mitigation plan i.e. re-run exports. 
As there is no feature or UI for CS to re-run the tasks, they are heavily dependent on engineering team.
