Systems must grow and change over time to continue to operate at peak capacity. Companies, people, and software are not static entities and there are many things that may precipitate the need for growth; business expansion, increased user demand, or even just evolving requirements. For this reason, it is important to grow an understanding of how to evaluate trade-offs when making architectural design decisions.
This section will cover common system design topics at a high-level, hitting most of the buzzwords. Note that there are as many ways to build a distributed system as there are to write a piece of software - if the system fits the requirements of the specification, then there is never a 
true
 correct answer to any system design problem. A system should ultimately fulfill the requirements of a company and its user base without diminishing the end user experience or, for that matter, 
the developer’s experience
.
Good architecture grants the flexibility and ability to change.
