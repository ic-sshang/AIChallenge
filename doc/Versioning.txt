URL-Based Versioning:
Incorporate the version number directly into the URL of the API endpoint. This provides clear separation between versions.
Example: 
/api/v1/products
, 
/api/v2/products
The internal version of APIs use the 
1.2.3
 format, so it looks as follows:
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
Major version:
 The version used in the URI and denotes breaking changes to the API. Internally, a new major version implies creating a new API and the version number is used to route to the correct host.
Minor and Patch versions:
 These are transparent to the client and used internally for backward-compatible updates. They are usually communicated in change logs to inform clients about a new functionality or a bug fix.  You would not change the version in the URL for these types of changes.
