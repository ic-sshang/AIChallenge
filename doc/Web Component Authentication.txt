Objective
 
This document outlines the authentication workflow for embedding the 
React MFE
 as a 
web component
 on third-party biller websites. It explains how public/private key validation, domain validation, and configuration management are handled securely via the server-side infrastructure. 
 
Web Component Integration Flow
 
Description:
 
To allow billers to embed our 
Web Component
, we expose it as a web component which is then hosted on the biller’s website. This component below parameters based on the given condition of the component à 
 
Condition
 
Parameter for web-component
 
Non-authenticated component 
<public key> 
Authenticated 
<public key>, <userId> 
 
Workflow:
 
Embedding (Client-Side):
 
The 
biller's site
 embeds the Web component, passing the 
public key
 and 
userId
(if needed) as an attribute. 
MFE Handling (Frontend):
 
The 
MFE
 (React-based micro frontend) receives the public key, domain (source) & userId(if needed). 
It then makes an 
API call
 to the backend, sending all the values for validation. 
Server-Side Authentication (IC Service):
 
The 
Backend Service IC
: 
Retrieves the associated 
private key
 using the provided public key. 
Decrypts
 the public key using the private key. 
Extracts the 
biller ID
 and other relevant metadata. 
Performs 
validation
: 
Public key validity
 - Ensures the public key exists and matches a known private key. 
Biller ID verification
 - Extracted from the decrypted public key and checked against the system. 
Domain verification
 - Ensures the request origin domain is authorized to use the provided public key. 
Upon successful validation, the system proceeds with the business logic and responds with appropriate user data. 
 
 
 
Biller Portal: Configuration Management
 
Purpose:
 
The 
Biller Portal
 provides an interface for billers to manage their authentication configurations such as 
public key
 and their 
domains
. 
Components:
 
Auth Configuration UI:
 
Allows billers to generate their 
public key
 and configuring 
domain
. 
Database Storage:
 
Key Settings Table
: Stores the 
public/private key pair
. 
Domain Settings Table
: Stores mappings between 
Biller ID
 and 
domains
. 
 
Conclusion
 
This authentication design ensures that only verified and configured billers can host the 
Web Component
 securely. The use of 
public/private key cryptography
, coupled with 
domain-level validation
, provides a robust and scalable authentication mechanism.
