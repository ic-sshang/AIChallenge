Security
Secure software
 - Appropriate software ensuring security of the virtual machine
Secure connectivity
 - Appropriate connection security requiring users to be on the InvoiceCloud VPN to connect and traffic outbound from the Jumpbox VMs routing thru the Palo Alto Firewall protecting the Network Swimlane the Jumpbox is within, i.e. traffic from the Jumpboxes in the NonProd Network Swimlane (which supports the Sandbox and DevTest Environments) goes thru the NonProd Palo Alto firewall instance and traffic from the Jumpboxes in the Prod Network Swimlane goes thru the Prod Palo Alto firewall instance.
