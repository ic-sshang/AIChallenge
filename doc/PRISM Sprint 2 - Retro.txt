Random Thoughts
Review the repo current state (build, recent commits, unit test, ai health check) before starting work on story.
As discussed, document the confirmations on the stories in the comments along with tagging the stakeholders.
Prioritize the dependent tasks before taking into sprint.
Validate all the builds and unit test cases (including AI health check) before moving to Deployment queue..
Tech lead should start doing code review
Developers to start testing stories.
Waiting for US scrum call for any clarification.
Merging branch to main/release before the testing in verification.
Great collaboration at office!
Peer Code review
We should try to have our Jira ticket updated in the right status, we are already doing this most probably.
Using channel for any discussion
for the repo we have to maintain the proper documentation in the jira like what the exact changes are made by anyone that should be documented properly.
KT within team.
Update the Acceptance Criteria with the updated requirements and/or issues and get the required confirmation if needed from the reporter or other stakeholders involved. 
 
We should have a team lunch outside soon! 
 
 
How about team outing 🙂
