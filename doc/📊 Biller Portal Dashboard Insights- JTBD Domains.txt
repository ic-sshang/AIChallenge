Objective
This project aims to define user roles, jobs to be done (JTBD), goals, gaps, and actionable insights to tailor dashboard content, navigation, and features to the needs of distinct roles within biller organizations.  
While the original intent was to develop persona-based models, insights from biller interviews revealed that a 
functional 
impact framework
 more effectively captures the cross-role patterns and priorities that emerged.This structure focuses on core functions rather than job titles, which allows for clearer alignment of needs, gaps, and opportunities across departments (better for skewed interviews).
🔍 What is the Functional Impact Framework?
The 
Functional 
Impact Framework
 is a custom synthesis tool organizing insights, tasks, or features based on the functions they serve within an organization and the impact they have on operations, rather than by job titles or departments. It borrows from the JTBD framework in terms of identifying jobs / tasks and outcomes while also identifying risks and opportunities t
✅ Benefits of This Approach
Cross-functional alignment
: Helps identify shared needs across departments and verticals (e.g., both Finance and Customer Service in Insurance and Government need better reporting).
Prioritization
: Makes it easier to prioritize improvements based on impact rather than role hierarchy.
Scalability
: Supports product design and system development by focusing on functional, task-based outcomes.
Clarity
: Reduces redundancy by grouping similar needs under one function.
