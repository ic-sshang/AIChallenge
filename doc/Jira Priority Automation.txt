Overview
The idea behind the automation is to assign an accurate priority for items based on different ticket properties. The properties will be used in a formula to assign a weight to the item. The weight will fall into four categories, P1-P4 (High-Low).
Formula and Weights
Ticket Properties
Urgency
Biller Tier
Reported Service
Assigning Weights
Urgency
:
Low: 1
Medium: 2
High: 3
Critical: 4
Biller Tier
:
Since there are different logic branches, we want to adjust these values to not be as impactful within its branch. This allows us to take the tiers into account within reason and letting the urgency and reported service fields drive the priority.
Tiers 1 and 2
Tier 1 - 500,000+: 1.50
Tier 2 - 250,000 - 499,999: 1
Other Tiers
Tier 3 - 100,00 - 249,9993: 2
Tier 4 - 50,000 - 99,999: 1.50
Tier 5 - Below 50,000: 1
Reported Service
:
High: 3
Medium: 2
Low: 1
Proposed Formula
Priority Weight = Urgency Weight × Biller Tier Weight × Reported Services Weight
To ensure that Tier 1 and 2 billers are at least a Medium priority, we will have a different branch in the logic that calculates the weight based on the Urgency and Reported Services.
Priority Weight = Urgency Weight × Reported Services Weight
Categorizing the Weights
For Biller Tiers 1 and 2
Min and Max:
Minimum Weight: 1
Maximum Weight: 18
Define The Ranges
P1 - High
: Top 5 weights.
Weights:  8, 9, 12, 13.5, 18
P2 - Medium
: Bottom 7 weights
Weights: 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 4.5, 6
For Biller Tiers 3-5
Min and Max
:
Minimum Weight: 1
Maximum Weight: 24
P1 - High
: Top 3 weights.
Weights:  16, 18, 24
P2 - Medium
: Next 4 weights
Weights: 8, 9, 12, 13.5
P3 - Low
: Next 4 weights
Weights: 3, 4, 4.5, 6
P4 - Lowest
: Bottom 3 weights
Weights: 1, 1.5, 2
For Empty Biller Tier
Min and Max:
Minimum Weight: 1
Maximum Weight: 12
Define The Ranges
P1 - High
: Top 2 weights.
Weights:  9, 12
P2 - Medium
: Next 2 weights
Weights: 6, 8
P3 - Low
: Next 2 weights
Weights: 3, 4
P4 - Lowest
: Bottom 2 weights
Weights: 1, 2

Pending Improvements / Considerations
Take Reported Service (or Scrum Team) into account.
Reported Service is now taken into account.
High Tier Billers, with low/medium urgency for a low/medium reported service.
This has been addressed with the split logic for tier 1 and 2 billers.
Low Priority Reported Services, with low urgency since we do not currently measure how many billers the issue is impacting. (e.g. Kiosk, Pay-by-Text)
Tickets that are not from Salesforce may be missing the Biller Tier. This may need to be accounted for. Maybe a default value can be assigned. Different buckets can be created for weights calculated without the Biller Tier.
This was addressed along with the change for tier 1 and 2 billers buckets.
Improvements
For Tier 1 and 2 billers, only assign medium or high priority.
Calculate tickets missing the tier using the remaining fields.
Possible Solution:
Create a field in the Jira DS project that is required in the portal.
An automation can be created to populate the true Biller Tier field based on the value of this 
backup 
field
.
This would require a change to Workato to set this value since it would needed in the portal.

Currently, the formula takes the Biller population-affected field into account. The issue with that is that the field is not always populated. It would require an engineer to understand the ticket's impact, which we typically don't know until we start working on the ticket.
I'm going to make a change to use the Reported Service instead, in addition to the Biller Tier and Urgency.
The weight of the Reported Service will match what is in the Priority Rubric

The changes are live for the Wicked Tendies scrum team. There are two automation rules (linked in the Automation section), one to run when any of the 3 fields are changed, and another to run when the ticket is moved to Pending status as this occurs for all tickets.
10/17/2024 4:09 PM:
Reworked the weights to ensure Tier 1 and 2 billers are at least Medium Priority. The change is also rolled out to Wicked Tendies and Integrations. The changes look good and will released to all teams shortly.
10/18/2024 8:59 AM:
The automation has been rolled out for all teams. Also, for the event listener rule, tickets with the Escalations label are being skipped since the priority should have been manually updated.
10/30/2024 4:13 PM:
Removed striked throught content from the document.
10/30/2024 4:35 PM:
Shift ranges for Tier 1 and Tier 2 billers since too many Tier 2 billers were getting weight 6 and being set to High when they were more of Medium priority ticket.
