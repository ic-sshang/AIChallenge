🧠 What Is an MCP Server?
At its core, an MCP Server acts as a 
universal connector
 between AI models and external systems. Think of it like a 
USB-C port for AI
: once set up, any LLM that supports MCP can plug into it and access a suite of tools or services without needing custom integrations for each one.
🔧 Key Features
Modular Architecture
: MCP Servers host various tools or services (like APIs, plugins, or microservices) that can be accessed dynamically by LLMs.
Standardized Interface
: They follow the MCP specification, making them interoperable across different AI platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini).
Real-Time Access
: They enable LLMs to fetch live data (e.g., weather, calendar events, emails) that the model wouldn’t otherwise know due to static training data.
Scalability
: Designed to support high-throughput, low-latency communication across cloud, hybrid, or on-prem environments.
🧩 How It Works
LLM (Host)
: The AI model acts as the MCP Host.
Client Interface
: The application using the LLM maintains a connection to the MCP Server.
MCP Server
: Provides a catalog of available tools and services. The LLM queries this server to perform tasks like sending emails, querying databases, or interacting with third-party APIs.
🛠️ Use Cases
Connecting LLMs to enterprise systems (e.g., CRM, ERP)
Enabling AI assistants to perform real-world actions (e.g., booking meetings, sending messages)
Creating reusable, centralized toolsets for multiple AI clients
