Summary
This only applies to projects where detailed management of the Milestone Tracker is necessary to effectively deliver the project. This is not needed for most implementations.  A second iteration of the Project Status dashboard was introduced to provide a direct display to the milestone tracker. The video below shows you how to update the Dashboard to point to your Milestone Tracker sheet.
