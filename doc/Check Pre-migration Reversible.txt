Once in a while, the Finance team will send us reversible items in the case bank account that are not showing up in the reporting. These are often caused by entries that were sent to the gateway that are tied to an old terminal (not the new cass terminal).
For example:
Biller is still 
not 
on Cass and has a matched entry on 10/1/2023. The payment has been settled and everything looks good. The next day, 10/2/2023, the Biller then goes live for Cass and there was a return/reversal triggered for that entry that was matched from the old terminal. Thinking they are now live on Cass, we send the returns/reversals to the gateway. This will create a discrepancy in our batch because these payments are not tied to Cass but to the old terminal.
