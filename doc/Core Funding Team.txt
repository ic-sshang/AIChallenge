Intro
The Core Funding NextGen Team AAD Groups are intended to enable the 3 standard levels of User access (Admin, Developer, Reader) per Environment to the Azure Resources that represent the Core Funding Spoke(s) within each specific Environment. There is also an Application Deployer AAD Group per Environment intended to provide the access signature needed by Core Funding Team Service Principals to deploy applications onto the Azure Resources. Note the same AAD Groups are used to enable access across Deployment Versions within a specific Environment.
