What is a Test Engineer?
A test engineer is an engineer that has volunteered (or has been assigned) to test a Jira item once the item has finished coding or a configuration change has been made. They will test the new functionality that is on the associated Pull Request or any functionality changes that are reported on the Jira item. 
“How To Test” Template
Before requesting a Test Engineer, be sure to include information on how to test as a comment on your Jira item. You should use the following template:
Prerequisite: 
[Write a short description of what is required before testing]
How to test:
[Write a short description of how to test]
For example, if your testing requires running a Unit Test method and a specific Advanced Setting needs to be enabled, you would write:
Prerequisite: 
Advanced Setting XX must be enabled
How to test:
Use unit test method exUnitTest() in \Repo\UnitTests.vb\
How do I request a Test Engineer?
The Assignee on the Jira item may post a request for a test engineer in a public Slack channel where relevant members can accept the request. They may also use a direct message.
For example, an engineer that is embedding with our Integration’s Product Team may ask for a Test Engineer in the Dev Support Slack channel or the Integration’s Product Team Slack channel. 
An engineer will then accept or deny the request. 
Test Engineer Request/Response Example
Request:
Requesting Test Engineer for Jira Item [Jira Item Number and Hyperlink]. Please reply to this post if you can assist. 
Response:
I am available for testing. I will update the Testing tab. 
Note: these are just examples. You may request/reply any way you prefer. 
Testing
Once the Test Engineer has accepted the request, they should navigate to the Jira item and fill in the Testing tab’s fields. 
Afterward, read and follow the Assignee’s message on how to test. 
“Test Complete” Template
Once testing is completed, make sure to fill out the “Test/Code” review field in the Testing tab and use the following template to post a comment that you have finished testing:
Test Description: 
[Describe how you tested the item]
Test Result:
[Test Succeeded \ Test Failed]
Note:
[Write any comments or concerns about your testing experience]
For example, if you test and the testing was unsuccessful, you would write:

I enabled Advanced Setting XX and ran the unit test. 
Test Result:
Test Failed
Note:
I encountered an unexpected exception during my testing. I will get with [Assignee] to review.
