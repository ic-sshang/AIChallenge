Problem Statement
#FFFAE6
Payers can register for accounts with saved payment methods already stored. Today, there is no validation in place to ensure the payment method belongs to the user registering for that account.
In our existing workflows the first user to login to an account with a stored payment method is considered the owner of that payment method. We do obfuscate the full payment details; however, we are not verifying that the user knows the information and should have access to that saved payment method.
Objective
Validate payment methods when a new user is registering for an account with a saved payment method
Value
Security
Secure registration process for accounts with stored payment methods
Enhanced trust & transparency on our platform
Lower risk for payment method errors or issues i.e., someone accessing a payment method that does not belong to them
Cost Savings and Revenue
Reduce support burden
Save costs by avoiding potential issues
More selling opportunities to prospective Billers with multi-user
User Journey
High-level User Journey
note
During the registration process, check if there is 1+ saved payment method on file with the account
Present a verification step to the user with the saved payment method
Applies to CC/ACH
Show the default saved payment method
If there is no default, then show the first saved payment method
User must enter the payment method details
For ACH: Bank Routing Number & Account Number
For CC: Full CC Number
Validate the payment info entered matches the saved payment method
If it matches, allow the user to register with the saved payment method
If it does NOT match, allow the user to re-enter the payment method X # of times
After the final attempt allowed:
Register the user and remove the saved payment methods
Notify user that AutoPay/Scheduled Payments will not continue, and a new payment method must be added in order to resume

Users
Payers
 or multi-users signing up for their account with saved payment methods
Billers 
with multi-users and saved payment methods converted
 Multi-user billers
 are more likely to have a user other than the payment method owner register first and get the payment method information 
User Goals
When I’m registering my account and there are payment methods associated with my account, I want to ensure the payment method is mine.
I don’t want my payment methods to be associated with any 
other
 accounts
If I don’t recognize a saved payment method, I want to add a new one.
User Flows
^ From 
Figma
 based on 2024 discovery
User Scenarios
What does the unhappy path look like when the payer does not know the default payment method?
Do we look for an alternative saved payment method if one exists in our system?
Do we allow registration?
Do we remove the payment method? 
Do we remove 
all
 associated payment methods?
If all attempts are tried and failed, should we direct the payer to the saved payment method page to add a new payment method?
What if the registering user doesn’t recognize the payment method? (Roommate scenario)
Do we provide ability to go directly to add a new payment method? 
Do we still register the user?
 Scenario 1: Validation Successful on the First Attempt – 
Happy Path
First entry to attempt to verify is successful
Save payment information
Register user
User enters Customer Portal
 
Scenario 2: Attempts Do Not Match – 
Unhappy 
to
 
Happy Path
First entry to attempt to verify doesn’t match – the UI should do this:
Error message
Allow the user to try again 
Success on 2nd or 3rd payment method entry
 
Scenario 3: All Attempts Failed & Unable to Verify – 
Unhappy Path
3 attempts 
is the common, expected standard across financial platforms
Allow up to 3 retry attempts
On final attempt, if the user fails we should:
UI: Show a message
Having trouble verifying? Add a new saved payment method. [CTA button]
CTA button brings user to the Saved Payments page
Backend: Remove associated payment method(s). Register the account.
 
Scenario 4:
 
User Doesn’t Recognize the Payment Method – 
Unhappy Path
When the user is registering their account & doesn’t recognize the payment method, they still need a way to securely register their account
In the UI there should be a message or CTA button for this scenario
Competitive Research
 🧩 Research UX Patterns & Competitors
Review how top payment platforms (RentCafe, ClickPay, InvoiceCloud, AppFolio) handle:
Retry attempts
Failed validation attempts
Reuse of existing methods
Unknown account resolution
Study UI behavior for:
Error messages
Retry limits
Removal or override of saved payment methods
Amazon
Feature Requirements
New UI flow for account registration with associated payment methods
Define the retry limit & behavior
Option for users that don’t recognize the payment method to continue in the registration flow
Option for users to add a new payment method option
