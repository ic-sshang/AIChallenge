 Ryan’s Recommendations
I'd recommend doing the following for the biller you identify:
Schedule time with the biller's CSM and IM to talk through history and any open issues/concerns
Review their config in the CRM to get familiar with how they are set up (and which integrations they utilize)
Review biller temp and recent cases in Salesforce
Send intro email (I've included mine below), try to keep the focus on observing and learning, but understand they're gonna want to vent if they have open issues
 Ryan’s Email Template
Hello Sandra,
My name is Ryan Pieszak; I'm with the Product team at InvoiceCloud. Our team places a strong emphasis on understanding the daily lives of our users, the processes they have in place, and the successes and challenges they face. It's our policy that each member of the Product team regularly visit with clients so the user perspective remains in very clear focus for us.
As a resident of Pasco County, I'd love the opportunity to spend the day with your staff, observe how they perform their duties, and listen to any feedback they have about the InvoiceCloud products and services they use.
If this is something you're okay with, please let me know and we'll coordinate on logistics that work for you and your staff.
Thank you.
