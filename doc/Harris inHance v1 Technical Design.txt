Balance Updates
inHance jobs:
On InHance this is called the "Balance Job". This job run every 15 minutes.
On InHance this is called the "Balance All Job". This job runs once a week on Sunday.
Both jobs update the IC ‘BalanceDue’ field
inHance makes two calls:
Inhance sends current balances to Invoice Cloud.
PaymentReportingDataSet
BillerPaymentWSReportHistoryDataSet
Payments 
This job runs every 15 minutes.
InHance downloads payments made on Invoice Cloud.
There are 2 ways to handle the payment coming from Invoice Cloud and the choice is (the Biller's) on how it will be handled:
Through pending payments or live to the account. If you go the pending payments route, all payments downloaded from Invoice Cloud will sit in the View Pending Payments screen under Batch Entries until someone (the biller) goes in and manually posts them.
If you choose to go the live route, all payments downloaded from Invoice Cloud will be posted directly to the customers’ accounts by a dummy clerk we (inHance) set up named IC Clerk. You (biller) will get a report through Open Transactions for this clerk for all payments made that day.

Change Logs (AutoPay, Paperless, Email, Phone Numbers)
Customer job: This job runs every hour.
Auto Pay job: This job runs every hour.
InHance makes two calls:
Customer job: This job downloads any flags or minor changes from Invoice Cloud -paperless, emails and phone numbers.
Auto Pay job: This job downloads a flag that tells inHance that Invoice Cloud will handle the ACH. When inHance downloads this flag, they set the customer to Draft and put dummy bank account info on the account. The bank name is Invoice Cloud Bank and the account number is 000000000 with a dummy routing number. If the biller does not currently handle any bank drafts at all, the biller will need to make sure they are including drafts when printing bills

IC does not have 'PayPal' as payment type in Data Pump class - clsInhance
Added support for the PayPal payment type in DataPump for InHance billers.
Not all billers were ready to accept paypal codes via Data Pump. This change should return “Credit Card” by default and if the Advanced Setting 116 is set, return that value instead.
