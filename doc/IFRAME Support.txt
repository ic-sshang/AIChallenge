The Payer Portal can be hosted in a browser IFRAME by partners.  There are a couple of key behavior changes in this mode that need to be handled.
How it works
Sessions are established using a SSO process, not in scope for this project.   
When the Partner/Biller is ready to redirect the user to the Payer Portal, they will redirect the user using a pre-defined URL.

ViewMode
ViewMode is required to identify how the user is accessing the Payer Portal pages. The correct value must be set in order to customize the experience. 
0
 = Default
1
 = iFrame
2
 = Dialog
CSSUrl
The value is only required if a Partner/Biller would like to customize the Payer Portal and if the value was not provided in the SSO process.
Use the SSOConnect PDF to get the CSS class names that need to be applied to specific UI elements.  
1.5 UI Support
The 
ViewMode
 will need to be passed to the 1.5 UI url as an optional query string parameter so that it can handle the various modes.
ViewMode = 1
The 1.5 UI will use a layout that does not show the primary navigation elements (header, menu, footer, sidebar).
Option 3:
 SSO Customer Login URL
This is used when option 23 is not configured
Option 23:
 SSO Customer LogOff URL
This is used for both logout and session expiration redirect
ViewMode = 2
The 1.5 UI will use a layout that does not show the primary navigation elements (header, menu, footer, sidebar) and show a Close button in the upper right hand corner.  Closing with close the current window via javascript.
