How we work: the centralized partnership
We operate with a 
centralized partnership model
 for design. That means design is a 
central function
 that partners with scrum teams, rather than being embedded and siloed inside them.
Here’s why:
Consistency
: Because we’re centralized, you’ll see design standards, systems, and practices applied across products, giving users a cohesive experience.
Efficiency
: We can shift design resources based on priority and demand, so your projects get the right support at the right time.
Collaboration
: You’ll have design engaged as a strategic partner, not just a service at the end of the line.
Expertise
: Centralization lets designers and front end developers learn from each other, share knowledge, and bring specialized skills into your projects.
Partnering assignments for designers and front end developers
To balance workload and establish subject matter expertise, designers and front end developers (FE Devs) are assigned to areas of the product, and thus corresponding scrum teams. Some product areas have much different needs than others (ex: payer experience generally requires more UX work than payments). For teams without a directly assigned designer/FE dev, the design team will swarm the request.

Scheduling work
PMs and POs can directly assign work to designers and FE devs. Heartbeat work (design system, evergreen UX research, etc) is managed by Matt Radel. 
All work needs to be tracked in Jira, with clear task descriptions and due dates. 
Work should be planned very similar to a sprint (we’d suggest planning work alongside or in sprint planning) to give proper lead time.
Designers
Work for designers is created and tracked almost exclusively in the 
product design (PD) project
 in Jira. Designers primarily conduct UX research, prototype, and user test.
FE Devs
Work for FE devs happens on the sprint along with all other work for the scrum team. FE devs typically build the UI for features, as well as the react components for our design system.
