Why do we need to upgrade:
Upgrading from Azure Basic Load Balancer to Standard Load Balancer is necessary because the Basic SKU will be retired on September 30, 2025. Standard Load Balancer offers significantly enhanced features, including high availability, zone redundancy, better performance, and improved diagnostics, making it a more robust and reliable option for most use cases. 
Upgrading Your Azure Basic Load Balancer to Standard:
 Log in to Azure 🔑
Use either Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell to log in to your Azure account and set the correct subscription:
Azure CLI:
Bash
az login

Azure PowerShell:
PowerShell
Connect-AzAccount
Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId <primary-subscription-id>

Replace 
<primary-subscription-id>
 with  Azure Subscription ID needed.
 Validate Load Balancer for Upgrade
 👀
Run the following PowerShell command to validate the upgrade compatibility:
PowerShell
Start-AzBasicLoadBalancerUpgrade -ResourceGroupName <loadBalancerRGName> -BasicLoadBalancerName <basicLBName> -validateScenarioOnly:$true

 (Replace 
<loadBalancerRGName>
 and 
<basicLBName>
 with  actual values)
This step identifies any potential issues before the actual upgrade.
 
Perform the Upgrade 
🚀
Execute the following PowerShell command to start the upgrade process:
PowerShell
Start-AzBasicLoadBalancerUpgrade -ResourceGroupName <loadBalancerRGName> -BasicLoadBalancerName <basicLBName> -StandardLoadBalancerName <newStandardLBName> -RecoveryBackupPath C:\BasicLBRecovery

Replace placeholders with your actual values. Ensure 
C:\BasicLBRecovery
 exists.
This command upgrades from basic to new Standard Load Balancer with the configuration (where possible) migrated from the Basic Load Balancer. A backup of the Basic Load Balancer configuration will be saved to the specified path.
Rollback (If Needed) ⏪
If any issues arise after the upgrade, you can revert to the original Basic Load Balancer configuration using the following PowerShell command:
PowerShell
Restore-AzBasicLoadBalancer -RecoveryBackupPath C:\BasicLBRecovery

Ensure the 
RecoveryBackupPath
 matches the one used during the upgrade.
 This command restores the Basic Load Balancer configuration from the backup. Remember to update DNS records back to the Basic Load Balancer's IP if you rollback.

:
 Thoroughly test your applications and services with the new Standard Load Balancer 🤔.
Consider one of the example below.
Search for you biller
in Profile > Misc Settings, update domain to 
http://preview.invoicecloud.com
 
in Users, hit the icon that looks like a person to login to the biller portal as a user
in biller portal, search customers for '%%%' 
hit the computer icon for one of the customers to login to the customer portal as that user
