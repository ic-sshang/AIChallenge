Stratus Invoice File Types:
727	IF_InCode - Utility Invoices - XML

This is a sample of a standard Tyler Incode Version 9 sample invoice file:
Stratus Adjustment File Types:

261	IF_InCode - Utility Adjustments - XML
290	IF_InCode UB Adjustment - CSV With Header - Include Dashes
 
This is a sample of a standard Tyler Incode Version 9 sample Adjustment file:
The biller provided files should be standard to Tyler Incode 9. The various converting file types on IC side are used to accommodate variations to data such as account number format (e.g. with/without dashes, prefixes). 
IF a biller’s file does not convert, we should push back and ask for a file in the format of the above provided samples
The following are known Payment , Miscellaneous and Changelog export filetypes used with biller’s currently implementing  Tyler Incode version 9:
Stratus Miscellaneous Export filetypes:
40		IF_City of Bloomington IL - Paperless Autopay Report

1	InvoiceCloud CSV Format
20	IF_Generic Change Logs - Account Number
Stratus Payment Export filetypes:
