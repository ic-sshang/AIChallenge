Create X-Ray Tests
As frontend developers most of our work is with the UI. Because of this most of our automated testing concerns are making sure we’re not breaking existing xpaths in the existing automation.
If for example, we are making a bunch of UI changes to a particular page, 
it’s better to create a single test,
 because adding a ton of non-automated, manual tests hurts our automation score in terms of the ratio of automated vs manual tests. Due to this, it’s better to create a single test and in the comments carefully list out the UI changes we have made.
Testing Tab
Under the 
Testing 
tab, scroll down to 
Test Coverage
, and hit 
Add Tests
.
If there isn’t an existing test, select 
New Test.
Add a 
Summary
Example when there’s a single change: As a payer using assistive technology, after I activate the close button on an error, the focus should move to the next focusable element on the pay by text page
Example when there’s many changes: Confirm the given page contains the correct UI changes based on the Figma
Add a 
Reason For Not Automating
In our case, with manual Accessibility and UI testing we’ll most often select 
Low Business ROI.
Add 
Not Automating Comments
Example: Manually using keyboard to navigate UI and assess accessibility.
Example: Manually confirming UI style changes

Repos Changed

Dev Work
Make the necessary changes in small, clean commits
Keep in mind the scope of all changes, searching for all instances of a given change 
Use 
present tense
 for commit messages
Example: 
change
 file path 
Example: 
add
 aria-hidden to img element
Save file formatting fixes for the last commit whenever possible
Be mindful of breaking any existing automated tests (changing xpath IDs, etc.)
Test your changes on localhost (
Test Round 1
)
Important!
 Always test mobile, not just desktop
 Always test changes in our iFrame context, not just windowed (desktop and mobile as well)

 Always check the automation repository to confirm we are not breaking any Xpaths. See Automated Testing below.

Testing before your story goes to the code review status helps catch any bugs.
Automated Testing
Locate Tests
Within QA_Src → 
test-customer-portal
 repo
Determine targeted elements under CustomerPortal.Specs > 
PageObjects
Items are listed under Common, CustomerPortal, VirtualSite
Target elements are at the very bottom of the 
___Page.cs
 files
Various targeted elements such as html elements, ID’s, string values, etc.
Find tests/features to run by Page/Feature under CustomerPortal.Specs > 
Features
Items are listed under CustomerPortal, Support, VirtualSite
You can run the entire page/feature tests by utilizing the Jira tag at the top of the page or run a specific test utilizing that specific Jira tag
Running Test
You should have already deployed to a devtest env (
devtest2
)
IF you're testing via 
pipelines
 instead of repo terminal:
In Azure > invoicecloud > QA_Src > Pipelines > test-customer-portal: 
https://dev.azure.com/invoicecloud/QA_Src/_build?definitionId=918
Run Test
Branch → 
Main
Database → 
TEST
Shard → Enter your shard # (example: 4156)
Browser Name → 
Chrome
Tag for FIlter → Include the relevant testing scenario: 
Jira-EBPP-1234
 (don't include 
@
 symbol and make sure there are no spaces in front)
If multiple tags you can typically run just 1
Run tests in sequential → 
Only if the Jira tag contains @sequential
Ex. @Jira:EBPP-23192 @ui @sequential
Run tests in parallel → 
check!
Test Execution Status → unchecked
IF you're testing in the terminal in VS code
git pull
 command in 
Test-Customer-Portal
 repo in visual studio code terminal
az login
 or 
az login --use-device-code
 if need be
dotnet build
dotnet test --filter Category=Jira:EBPP-5373 -e database=TEST -e shard=4156 -e keepStagedData=true
If ever unsure about about tests always check in with a Test Engineer
When our UI changes break these connections the automation tests will fail. Coordinate with QA to ensure these stay up to date.
Deployment and Readiness Process
Code Review
The tech lead and other developers will review your PR when you bring it to PR review meeting and post in the 
dude-spam
 slack channel.
Ready for Testing
Communicate to the team to find someone willing to be the test engineer to test your changes on devtest2. Usually this is another frontend developer. (
Test Round 3
)
Set to ready for testing.
In Testing
If you are the test engineer for an item, set the status to 
In Testing.
Final Review
Once your changes have been verified by a test engineer on devtest2, change the Jira status to 
Tech Lead Review 
and post in the slack channel that you have a PR ready for review to look at before or during the team PR review call.
Once, tech lead review is complete, the story will move on to the 
Deployment Queue 
column.
The tech lead will add the 
Fix Version
 to the 
Fix Versions 
field in the right column of the Jira story.
Example: 
2024-05-09
Regression Testing
Once in the deployment queue, you will need to test your changes again (
Test Round 4
), ideally during the day before the release meeting.
Within the prod CRM use the regression biller (bid 2002)
https://qa-regression.invoicecloud.com
Test your changes
In Jira > 
Deployment
 tab > Change 
Passed Regression
 to: 
PASSED
Final Testing:
Tuesday and Thursday nights at 10:00 PM Eastern
Testing on 
preview
 (
Test Round 5
)
Preview is a 
public
 endpoint, so you’ll want to hit it 
outside of the AVD. 
Code will move from regression to preview the day of the release. Test on preview as soon as it is deployed there. See the 
release-prod-engineering
 slack channel.
With your demo biller or a regression biller in the production CRM, simply change the subdomain to preview once the site loads.
If you want to hit the payer portal, take this URL
https://preview.invoicecloud.com/portal
and append the payer token string copied from the “Login as account owner” link
/CustomerLogin.aspx?ETG=WXlBVEJHL3R6dmxPWVdqOE5CcDh0NlNTVERGbEsxaFlucTUzT2lPcm9mV0dJcmRMZDRSeVE3eW9FeU9BdHVOMHUwMkxKNkRZVzVHNEZkWXp4RTBUWHdqM3lmd3pRcWNMRlpFNlhXOVloTDlyU1ZoSDQ3OGdqaW1DVmdSNjUxMTlYOGZvZHZmY3FDN1VzNWM2eFh5aytRPT0=&bp=1
