When a user pays a biller through InvoiceCloud, the billed amount is initially moved from the user account to the InvoiceCloud PayPal account. When the terminal's batch is closed, these payment amounts are sent to the biller in batches. In some scenario, the user's selling amount is transferred to the biller, but the user later disputes the payment, and the money must be returned to the user. In these scenarios InvoiceCloud refunds the disputed amount to the user, now this amount has to recovered from the biller. InvoiceCloud uses RMM (Reverse Money Movement) methods to recover money from the biller.
Before the implementation of this story, the RMM methods tries to recover the whole payment amount from the biller including the convenience fee. Billers are not liable to return the convenience fee on the sale amount, it must be recovered from the subscribers. 
As part of this story, we will create new RMM methods (keeping the existing methods) which will recover the sale amount from the biller and convenience fee from the subscriber for a disputed payment.
We have added these two RMM methods which will be used in the PayPalChargebackProcessing and PayPalACHRejectProcessing Jobs.
