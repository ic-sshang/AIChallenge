Medium Rocks (MVP vs Day‑1 vs Future)
How to Read the Table
Rows = Capabilities (Big Rocks)
 → Each row is a core capability (e.g., Wizard, KYC, Funding Config). Marked as 
Must
 or 
Should
 from workshops.
Columns = Phases of Readiness
MVP = Regulatory Baseline
 → Minimum controls required by Chase/regulators. Manual, Ops-driven. Goal: 
Legally live
 (1–3 billers).
Day-1 = Operational Baseline
 → Minimal automation to support ~20 billers. Light UI/API builds. Goal: 
Operationally viable
.
Day-90+ = Optimization & Scale
 → Efficiency, self-service, advanced integrations. Goal: 
Reduce manual work & scale growth
.
Color Codes in Cells
🔴 
Net-New Dev (High Effort)
 – API, service, or UI build.
🟡 
Partial Dev (Medium Effort)
 – CRM config, vendor API, workflow extension.
🟢 
Ops/Policy (Low Effort)
 – Manual workaround or process only.
Open Qs / Decisions / Blockers

Estimation
Effort (S/M/L/XL)
 = raw build/test work.
Complexity (Low/Med/High)
 = cross-team, integration, vendor/Chase risk.

Open Questions / Decisions / Blockers
Payer Fraud Monitoring (Card Testing, Velocity)
Detect payer-side fraud: card testing, velocity spikes, stolen BINs. 
MoSCoW: Must
.
🟢 
Leverage existing Kount (legacy stack)
 for card testing. 
WT-233
2278e126-27dc-36c8-aef9-a32d91bc7ad7
System Jira
 
🟢 Basic Ops velocity checks + Chase fraud alerts.
WT-234
2278e126-27dc-36c8-aef9-a32d91bc7ad7
System Jira
 
🟡 Extend 
Kount integration  into PayFac stack
 + 
basic Ops dashboard
 for fraud/velocity exceptions.
WT-235
2278e126-27dc-36c8-aef9-a32d91bc7ad7
System Jira
 
🟡 Configurable velocity rules (txn count, $ thresholds, MCC anomalies). 🟡 Alerts routed into Ops dashboards.
WT-236
2278e126-27dc-36c8-aef9-a32d91bc7ad7
System Jira
 
🔴 ML anomaly detection (card testing + synthetic IDs). 🔴 Adaptive scoring
WT-237
2278e126-27dc-36c8-aef9-a32d91bc7ad7
System Jira
   (device/IP/BIN). 🔴 Evaluate Kount expansion vs. dedicated AML/fraud vendor.
Decision:
 Confirm if Kount remains card-testing only or extended to AML.
Biller AML Monitoring
Detect suspicious biller activity (refund laundering, abnormal deposits). 
MoSCoW: Should
.
🟢 Ops manually reviews refund patterns + outliers via reports.
🟡 AML rule-based scenarios (e.g., >X% refunds, round-dollar spikes). 
🟡 Alerts into Ops dashboard.
🔴 Dynamic AML risk scoring, reserves auto-adjusted. 
🔴 Dedicated AML tooling.
Decision:
 No AML vendor selected. Evaluate if Kount or separate system.
Chargeback & Dispute Monitoring
Track chargeback ratios vs network thresholds. 
MoSCoW: Must
.
🟢 Ops manually monitors with Chase/Amex outputs. 🟢 Ratios tracked in spreadsheets (Visa 1%, MC 0.9%).
🟡 Chargeback dashboards (ratios, 30/90-day trending). 🟡 Exception queues to Ops.
🔴 Predictive monitoring (alerts before breach). 🔴 Integration with dispute mgmt tools.
Decision:
 Ops vs Finance owns chargeback SLA.
Evidence & Audit Logging
Capture compliance evidence (OFAC, CIS delivery, payouts, fraud/AML alerts). 
MoSCoW: Must
.
🟢 Evidence stored manually (CRM, logs, spreadsheets).
🟢 Continue manual capture.
🔴 Automated audit log (system-captured evidence, retention policies, searchable). 
🔴 RegTech integration for compliance attestations.
Decision:
 Define retention length (5 vs 7 yrs).
Policy & Risk Dashboards
Unified view of risk/compliance exceptions for Ops/Compliance. 
MoSCoW: Should
.
— Not MVP (Ops uses spreadsheets + manual reports).
🟡 Day-1 dashboard consolidating fraud/AML/chargeback alerts.
🔴 Advanced heatmaps + predictive analytics (biller/geo/rail).
Decision:
 Tooling choice: extend CRM vs. new system.
