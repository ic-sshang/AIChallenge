Invoice File- First Half Mapping
File Summary/Purpose: The purpose of this file is transfer bill/invoice data to IC from the biller
File Extension:  .txt
File Naming Convention: 
File Delimiter:  ',' (comma)
Specification: Column headers

Adjustment/Daily Balance File - RE / PP 1st Half
File Summary/Purpose: The purpose of this file is transfer bill/invoice updated balance data to IC from the biller
File Extension:  csv
File Naming Convention: 
File Delimiter: ',' (comma)
Specification: Column Headers
Sample File: 
First Half Sample
FTP File Path:
File Transfer Frequency: Daily
There will be two mappings for the adjustment / daily balance file with TWO different locations / tasks on SFTP. Mahoning has confirmed all users will either be on 1 or 2 at same time.
**Note: The automatically generated file from Mahoning has the first row as headers, and the second row as filler data (-----,---------------,---------,-----------,------------,-------------): Read the headers from the first row but please skip the second row as it will not be readable. If possible, the code should try to rea the second row and see if it’s actual data and if not skip to make most flexible for future implementations. If this is not possible just skip second row.
