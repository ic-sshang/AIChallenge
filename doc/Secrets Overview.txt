Developing with Azure KeyVault
Azure KeyVault plays a crucial role in the modern application infrastructure within our organization, serving as the centralized repository for managing application secrets, cryptographic keys, and other sensitive assets. 
As we strive for consistent security practices, it's essential that all teams have a clear understanding of how to effectively use and integrate Azure KeyVault into their development processes. This section provides an  overview of Azure KeyVault and how to access them at InvoiceCloud.
What is Azure KeyVault
Simply put, it is a secure store where we can house a number of things like certificates, keys, and secrets. 
For more information on what you can do with a KeyVault, please see the following documentation:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/basic-concepts
 
At Invoice Cloud, where do we use the Key Vault?
The key vault serves as a secret store and we utilize the it to store "secrets". 
These secrets can be any of the following:
Credentials
Urls
Guids
etc.
How to gain access to the vault(s)?
We are leveraging Azure Active Directory (AAD) to store groups that have access to the Vaults.
Please submit a Service Desk ticket to be added to any of the "user" groups.
For DevTest:
IC-KeyVault-Test-User
This is the standard user group that will have reader access to the control and data planes. 
IC-KeyVault-Test-Admin
This is an elevated user group that will have administrator access to the control and data planes. 
IC-KeyVault-Test-Apps
This is a group specific for applications  that will have reader access to the control and data planes. 
For Production:
IC-KeyVault-Prod-User
This is the standard user group that will have reader access to the control and data planes. 
IC-KeyVault-Prod-Admin
This is an elevated user group that will have administrator access to the control and data planes. 
IC-KeyVault-Prod-Apps
This is a group specific for applications  that will have reader access to the control and data planes. 
So, what vaults are available for us to use?
Currently, we have two that we can use.
