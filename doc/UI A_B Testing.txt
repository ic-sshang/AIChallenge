In order to develop the UX to the meet the current UI requirements a A:B side by side approach should be used.  There is a test biller in production that can be used to compare and to help identify difference/defects.
Below the left side is the UI showing the test biller in the production environment.  The right side is the new UI using a dev test biller in the development environment.  Navigate and make note of anomalies (layout, fonts, color, sizing, etc…) and convert them to Jira tickets to be worked by the UI team. 
Accessing the production test biller:
Sign into production CRM
Search for BillerID 301 on left
Go to Users on left side

Go to Search > Customers
Enter "@" for Email Address and hit Submit.
Right click on Login as Account Owner on first row to get the temporarily shareable link that takes you into Customer Portal signed in.  You can click on that icon too and it'll take you there.
