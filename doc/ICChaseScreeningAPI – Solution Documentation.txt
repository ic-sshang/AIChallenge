Overview
ICChaseScreeningAPI is a .NET 8 Web API for merchant onboarding, document upload, and integration with Chase Payment Solutions. It supports file uploads, merchant creation, document retrieval, and health monitoring.
Architecture
•	Web API: Exposes REST endpoints for merchant and document operations.
•	Core Services: Business logic (MerchantDomainService, UploadFileService, etc.).
•	Azure Blob Storage: Stores uploaded documents.
•	Azure Key Vault: Secures secrets and credentials.
•	Database: Persists merchant and document metadata.
•	External Integrations: Connects to Chase Payment Solutions.
Authentication & Security
•	Most endpoints are [AllowAnonymous] for now.
•	Azure Key Vault access uses managed identity.
•	Sensitive configuration is stored in Key Vault or environment variables.
