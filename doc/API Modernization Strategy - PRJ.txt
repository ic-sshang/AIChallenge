Inventory SOAP APIs
:  List all of the SOAP services and operations. 
Identify Personas
: Determine the different personas that interact with the SOAP APIs.
Service Decomposition
: Break down the monolithic SOAP APIs into smaller, manageable micro RESTful APIs based on the domains and persona.
API Contracts:
 Define clear API contracts for each micro API, focusing on the inputs, outputs, and interactions.
API Documentation:
 Use Open API specification to define the contracts
Incremental Refactoring:  
Gradually refactor the monolithic SOAP APIs into RESTful micro APIs starting with the most used APIs or based on client contract requirements.
Authentication and Authorization:  
Implement OAuth 2.0 for customer integrations.  Use JWT authentication for internal integrations.
API Gateway: 
 Use Kong to manage API routes, authentication, and developer API specifications and UX
Integration Testing:  
Write tests for individual micro API contracts
