Greater scope than previously expected (more pages require updates).
Should have been defined more thoroughly by Product before committing.
Did not impact any billers directly (no external pressure was on this date)

PRISM support was more than expected, particularly with testing their stories.  The team is becoming more independent, support load is reducing.  Are we hiring SDET?
Release blockers/delays caused completed code to sit and wait.  Biller Portal breakout will help here.  This project also contributed to delays, the merging effort took more time than expected.
Possibly vacation schedules played a role.  30% carve out will help here.
