Random Thoughts
Update the Scenarios in (Given-When-Then) format along with the Acceptance Criteria in the stories. 
 to check on who should be owning these updates for the tickets.
Add X-Ray test cases based on scenarios.
Please start documenting the spike while the spike is progressing, if we will create that document on the last day of the sprint, there won’t be much time to review the document.
For stand ups please provide the updates on what we did yesterday, what are we going to do today and if we are facing any impediments. We are mostly doing this which is great, but missing a few updates sometimes.  
Avoid making/accepting late changes to sprint tickets.
Accepting story with build pipeline having unit test case failure
Using channel for any discussion
Continue maintaining proper documentation and proof of concept (POC) on the Spike tickets.
Review the repo current state (build, recent commits, unit test, ai health check) before starting work on story. Recheck before moving to “Deployment Queue“
As discussed, document the confirmations on the stories in the comments along with tagging the stakeholders.
Prioritize the dependent tasks before taking into sprint.
We should have a team lunch outside soon! 
 
 
How about team outing 🙂
