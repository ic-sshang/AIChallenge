Summary
RTDR creates invoices as well as refreshing balances. Fulton send an invoice file once a year that creates invoices and customer records. Throughout the year as RTDR is performed we create new invoices in our system. IC makes a call to Selectron endpoint to return all bills for an account. We go through each bill and generate the invoice number then query to see if it exists. If it does exist we just update the BalanceDue and TotalAmountDue. If it doesn’t exist we create a new invoice. 
BIF Customizations do not get applied to newly created invoices
Two Invoice Cloud products to manage the invoice records RTDR and Cloud Pay
API Endpoint uses Certification Authorization 
Dynamic Creation of Bills
We have a unique landing page for them: FultonCounty.aspx.vb when they redirect from Selectron to Invoice Cloud.
We check if the customer exist for the AccountNumber. If the customer exists, and biller option 46 is enabled, we compare the current customername in our database to theirs, if it is different we convey the account.
If the customer does not exist, we attempt to create the customer by calling their API and getting the customer information.
Afterwards, we call RTDR to update the customer's Invoices.
In the URL they are passing the account number. If the account number already exists we bring them to landing page and do RTDR. If it doesn’t exist we create the Customer Record and invoices.

Description
Request
Response
RTDR: Balance Update
Summary/Purpose:
RTDR is called whenever there is a payment redirect from Selectron to Invoice Cloud.
It will call for open bills for the account - if the account / bills don’t exist in IC it will automatically create it through the endpoint.
Endpoint
: /TaxServiceIC/WebTaxExternalService.svc
SearchTaxBill
SelectronFultonValidateCustomerBasicHttpLiveV2
Returns open tax bills for the given account.
Updates based on logic 08/11/2025 :  When performing an RTDR call for Sewer/Solid Waste,
 if the response object returns zero details,
 we are treating that as a failed RTDR call (setting wasteSearchResult = False). 
This request is to change that to handle it as a successful call instead (wasteSearchResult = True, sewerInfoNotFound = True)
. This logic was confirmed on a call with Selectron as not all accounts will have Solid Waste details. (
SelectronFultonValidateCustomerBasicHttpLiveV2 line 3028 - 3030 missing logic above 
) needs update to reflect the above logic. And above logic will be applied globally.
Parameter - Account Number
Any 200 response is considered successful:
Successful 200 response is considered good whether it has only tax bills, only sewer bills, both tax and sewer, or no bills at all
No validation is required on which type of bills are in the response
If bill already exists, 
IC updates: 
Balance Due from 
Selectron
: amount
TotalAmountDue from 
Selectron
: 
OriginalAmount
InvoiceDueDate from 
Selectron
: DueDate
Example response from Selectron:
"DueDate":"2023-09-30T00:00:00"
Remove the time and use standard IC formatting for Date.
From 
Selectron 
if
 
SheriffOfficeOnly
 is 
true
 then Block Payments for Credit/Debit Card & ETF/ACH of account.
If bill doesn’t exist, 
IC uses the following fields to create a new invoice:
BillerID
:

invoicetypeID
: Based on (
Selectron

if they pass year 9999 we do not update record (must mean no bill exists)
From 
Selectron 
if
 
SheriffOfficeOnly
 is 
true
 then Block Payments for Credit/Debit Card & ETF/ACH of account.
BillerBulkRTDR: 
Nightly RTDR Process
Summary/Purpose: Use new endpoint (GetBillAdjustments) as part of a daily process to get list of accounts that need to be updated, accounts that have new bills, and new accounts with bills. Then call SearchTaxBills only for those parcels to create new bills and update existing ones.
BillerBulkRTDR 
is an IC automated process in Skybot scheduled to run once a day at 8:00 AM Eastern Time. This pulls a list of accounts for each BillerID configured in the process and passes to RTDR in each run.
GetBillAdjustments 
returns a list of parcels that have a tax adjustment date equal to or more recent than the specified date.
 
  
GetBillAdjustments 
– returns a list of parcels that have a tax adjustment date equal to or more recent than the specified date.
Input:
Date 
(DateTime) – if left empty the current day will be used.
Output:
Message 
– error or success message
Parcels 
– list of parcels that have a Tax Adjustment Date >= the date entered. Each parcel item has a ParcelId (string) and AccountNumber (string).

File Mapping
Invoice File
File Summary/Purpose: The purpose of this file is transfer bill/invoice data to IC from the biller. The file we receive from them is a fixed length file that is a long string where certain fields are in certain places of file. There are three different file mappings (Personal Property, Real Estate, Sewage) - the only fields that differ across each file mapping is InvoiceNumber and Custom1. Invoice File from Fulton County is AIS World / Tyler Technologies File Spec.  The files sent via FTP and billerftpprocessing picks up the files which are relayed through stratus web services. Invoice files can also be generated via RTDR when there is no invoices found for a particular account.

Data Flow - Change Log
Paperless is billing is not sent back to Selectron / IAS World. Invoice Cloud does not receive a bill image so it is not possible to present EBill. That is done through selectron.
