Purpose
This initiative aims to integrate 
Mob Programming/Debugging
 into the Dev Support team to improve debugging efficiency, reduce aging tickets, and shorten overall cycle time. Mob sessions are designed to support engineers when they’re stuck—but should not be the sole method for resolving tickets.
What is a Mob?
A 
Mob
 is a small, collaborative group of engineers (2–5 people) working together in real time to solve a problem. Team members rotate roles every 10–15 minutes to encourage shared ownership and learning.
Mob Roles
Navigator
: Guides the problem-solving process and incorporates input from the team.
Driver
: Operates the keyboard, implementing the Navigator’s instructions.
Crowd
: Observes, suggests ideas, and supports the Navigator’s decisions.
Types of Mobs
Blob (Unstructured Mob)
Informal, flexible sessions with 2–5 engineers. Ideal for simpler issues or learning opportunities. Roles do not need to rotate. Usually these are formed at any time in 
product reliability continuous meeting
.
Mob (Structured Mob)
Initiated by 2–3 Dev Support Engineers, with up to 5 participants. Used for more complex debugging. Roles should rotate.
Cross-Team Mob
Includes at least 2 Dev Support Engineers and 1 Product Engineer. Used when collaboration across teams is needed. This mob can be structured but is not required
Mob Session Formats
Daily Sessions
India Team
Mon–Friday
7:30 AM CST
US Team
Mon–Friday
2:00 PM CST
On-Demand
If the scenario merits it,  a mob  can be formed at any time. However, this can be very time consuming for team members. Thus it is highly encouraged to meet in the scheduled sessions, and only use on-demand mobs for very high priority or aging items.
