release_mm_dd_yyyy
(For e.g. release_01_01_1999)
Pre-release stabilization
Mirror of main (After cut-off time)
Release Team/Tech Leads
Restricted after cut-off
Code freeze for that release.
No merges are allowed 
If any code needs to be fixed or any exception only Tech Lead from the respective scrum team is allowed to merge the code(with Approvals)
A PR must be opened to merge back to main if any changes made to this branch due to some exceptions
Currently creation of the branch and build are manual, we are working on automation for the same
