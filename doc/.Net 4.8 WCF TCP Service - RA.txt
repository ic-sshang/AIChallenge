Configurations and Settings
Environment specific configuration settings should be provided by Environment Variables.  This is how Kubernetes provides settings to Pods on startup.   
App.Configs and Web.Configs
A configuration builder can be use to pull values from Environment Variables as well as standard .config files.

Microsoft has a implementation that does this.

Logging
Container entry point applications should write logs to the STDOUT and STDERR streams.  Kubernetes listens to these steams and writes container logs on the host node.  These log files can be shipped to a log aggregator, like New Relic.  For Net 4.8 the Console is what is used to write to these steams..   If you are using the Serilog library you can configure it to output to the Console.  If you are writing to files directly or to some other log store you should update the code to use the Console.
Ports
WCF services that expose services using binary protocols and proprietary ports will use the Azure Load Balancer to register and the expose the traffic to external systems.
