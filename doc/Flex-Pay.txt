General Description: 
Customers have the ability to make installment payments on bills using a simple self-service selection called Flex Pay. The customer elects how many payments he or she would like to schedule, over what period of time, and using what method of payment. Please note: In the Customer Portal the system will automatically lower the number of payments if it finds that the time frame between the start and end date cannot result in the max number of payments configured. Once the flex pay schedule is made, the customer receives confirmation of the flex pay schedule and individual email reminders three days prior to each date payments are scheduled to be processed.
