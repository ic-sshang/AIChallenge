Tyler New World sends duplicate records in the invoice file when the biller prints 2 bills, one for the landlord and one for the tenant. The only way to solve this is by the client removing one of the payers (usually the landlord) from the bill/print.
Ideally, sales will warn Billers about this limitation.
