IC.ApplicationAuthService Package Issue
The IC.ApplicationAuthService nuget package is NOT being added as a required dependency.   This results in a file not found runtime exception.  The temporary fix is to add the latest IC.ApplicationAuthService nuget package to the primary executing project (Web API).   We need to determine which microservice runtime package requires this and fix the dependency issue.

 does not resolve
When testing RTDR the tunnel API HTTP call fails as it is unable to resolve the host from within the cluster.  This impacts all the “www” APIs we use, like CTP.

Obsolete Repo Assets
We no longer need the legacy folder .”kubernetes” and its YAML contents in the repo.   The Helm upgrade has made them obsolete.  Need to delete this folder to avoid confusion.

Jagged appsettings.json entries
Database settings like DBLIVE_NAME and DBLIVE_CATALOG need to be moved under “Database:VaultSettings:” for consistency across all services
{
  "Database":{
    "VaultSettings":{
      "DBLIVE_NAME": "blah",
      "DBLIVE_CATALOG": "blah"
    }
  }
} 
These means that the deployment YAML ENV variable names would now be 
Database__VaultSettings__DBLIVE_NAME
 and 
Database__VaultSettings__DBLIVE_CATALOG
.
