Writing clear and effective Git commit messages is essential for maintaining a well-organized and understandable codebase. Here are some best practices to follow:
Keep It Short:
Limit your commit message to 
less than 150 characters
. Concise messages are easier to read and understand.
Commit smaller changes at a time to help achieve brevity.
Use the Imperative Mood:
Write commit messages in the 
imperative mood
, as if giving a command.
For example:
Bad: “Fixed a bug.”
Good: “Resolve null pointer exception in UserController.”
