Expand each section for guidance on each area
1. Adoption Modeling
Objective:
 Estimate how many clients will adopt SSO/MFA and at what pace
Guidance
Steps:
Segment clients by vertical
 (government, utility, municipal, insurance).
Create adoption curves
 (conservative, baseline, aggressive) using historical adoption rates of similar features or market research.
Use a 
time-based ramp
 (e.g., 10% adoption in Year 1, 30% in Year 2, 50% in Year 3, etc.).
Adjust adoption rate based on:
Client size (by bill volume)
Regulatory pressure
 (e.g., stricter MFA requirements in government)
Digital maturity
 of the client
2. Usage Modeling
Objective:
 Estimate how often users will authenticate, and which authentication methods will be used
Guidance
Steps:
Use average number of 
logins per user per month
 (e.g., 3–5 times for B2B users).
Estimate user base per client (e.g., 5 users per small utility, 100+ for large insurer).
Break down login types:
SSO only
SSO + MFA
MFA (SMS vs. email vs. app-based TOTP)
Factor in password reset flows if you're also offering identity lifecycle management.
Palash:
The users for the Billers who wouldn’t have there own Identity Providers for their organization, would be using our SSO Sign page integrated with SecureAuth, if the users will have MFA configured they will redirect to the MFA sign in page, otherwise they would be redirected directly to our Biller Portal.
The users for the Billers who have their own Identity Provider would be getting the option to log in to our Biller Portal through their own SSO integrated Apps. The link for our Biller portal will check for these billers if there is an active token, if yes they will sign in automatically, if not, they will be redirected to their own SSO Sign In page.
The users for the Billers who don’t have their own Identity provider can also choose to not opt for SSO and just Opt for MFA and any of the factors we will be providing.
The Billers can choose to opt neither for SSO nor for MFA, but we can decide to make SSO mendatory for the Billers, which won’t change anything for such Billers for now, if they are not having their own IDPs.
3. Cost Modeling
Objective:
 Identify and quantify direct and indirect costs
Guidance
Components:
a. 
Identity Provider (IdP) Licensing Fees
Price per 
monthly active user (MAU)
 or 
per authentication
 (based on provider: Auth0, PingIdentity, Azure AD, etc.)
Include 
tiered pricing
 or volume discounts
Provider
Cost per MAU
Cost per Auth
Notes
Auth0
$0.02–$0.05
$0.001–$0.01
Varies by tier
PingIdentity
Custom
Custom
Enterprise-heavy pricing
Azure AD
~$6/user/mo
-
For full P1/P2 features
b. 
MFA Delivery Costs
Email:
 $0.001–$0.005 per email
SMS:
 $0.01–$0.03 per message (US); varies internationally
Push-based MFA (e.g., Authenticator apps):
 Often no per-use cost, but platform fees apply
c. 
Support Costs
Initial support ticket lift due to onboarding
Ongoing support per auth incident (~$1–$5 per support ticket depending on severity)
4. Revenue Modeling
Objective:
 Estimate revenue from offering SSO/MFA as a value-added service
Guidance
Steps:
Define pricing strategy:
Flat monthly fee per client
Per MAU or per authentication
Tiered pricing
 (Basic, Advanced, Enterprise)
Client Vertical
Price/MAU
Notes
Government
$0.20
Likely to pay for security/compliance
Utilities
$0.15
Price-sensitive, regulatory-driven
Municipal
$0.10
Small budgets, value simplicity
Insurance
$0.25
High security needs, can afford premium features
Estimate 
conversion rate
 for paid tier
Include 
setup fees
, if applicable
5. Competitive Benchmarking
Objective:
 Understand what competitors charge and offer
Guidance
Steps:
Identify direct competitors (e.g., Paymentus, ACI, Kubra, One Inc)
Research:
Do they offer SSO/MFA?
Is it bundled or an add-on?
What are the price points?
Use public pricing or customer interviews to inform assumptions
Palash: From Copilot:
1. One Inc
SSO/MFA Support:
 Not explicitly listed on their public site, but One Inc emphasizes PCI compliance and secure digital payment experiences, suggesting enterprise-grade security features are likely included.
Bundled or Add-on:
 Likely bundled as part of their secure payment platform.
Pricing:
 Not publicly disclosed. Pricing is typically customized based on client size and integration needs.
2. Kubra (EZ-PAY)
SSO/MFA Support:
 While not explicitly stated, Kubra emphasizes 
PCI compliance
, 
data security
, and 
fraud prevention
, which often includes MFA. Their 2025 trends report recommends MFA for billers.
Bundled or Add-on:
 Likely bundled as part of their enterprise offering.
Pricing:
 Not publicly listed. Vendors must be contacted for quotes. No free version or trial is available.
3. Point & Pay
SSO/MFA Support:
 Specific details on SSO/MFA were not found in public documentation. However, as a government and utility-focused payment processor, it likely includes security features such as MFA.
Bundled or Add-on:
 Assumed bundled, but confirmation from vendor is recommended.
Pricing:
 Not publicly available. Typically customized for municipalities and agencies.
4. BS&A Software
SSO/MFA Support:
 BS&A provides integrated payment solutions for municipalities. While detailed security features like SSO/MFA are not listed, their systems are designed for secure government use, implying such features may be available.
Bundled or Add-on:
 Likely offered as part of broader system integrations.
Pricing:
 Not publicly disclosed. Pricing is typically based on modules and local government size.
Assumptions Based on Industry Standards
SSO/MFA
 are increasingly standard in enterprise and government payment platforms.
Bundling:
 These features are often bundled in enterprise-grade solutions, especially when PCI compliance is a requirement.
Pricing:
 Most vendors offer 
custom pricing
 based on transaction volume, integration complexity, and client size. Public pricing is rare.
6. Sensitivity Analysis
Objective:
 Understand how variables affect financial outcomes
Guidance
Include key variables:
Adoption rate (low/med/high)
Number of authentications per user
IdP pricing variance
SMS volume and carrier pricing
Revenue per client vs. costs
Build scenarios:
Best case:
 High adoption, high per-client revenue
Expected case:
 Baseline assumptions
Worst case:
 Low adoption, high SMS usage
7. Financial Model Output
Guidance
Deliverables:
P&L impact by year (3–5 year projection)
Per-client profitability
