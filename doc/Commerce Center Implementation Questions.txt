What should “
captureMethod
” be set to when processing payments with Commerce Center? 
Options are “
NOW
”, “
DELAYED
”, “
MANUAL
” 
We currently pass “AC” on the SOAP APIs which allows us to void before a batch closes or refund after the batch has closed. 
Chase confirmed this is up to how we want to implement. The “EndOfDay” call is no longer necessary so we would need to determine if we want to let them Capture Payments which would follow based on the “DELAYED” or “MANUAL. Delayed does offer a 120min to 3 day window. “MANUAL” would be up to us to trigger the captures. One thing to note, once the capture is sent, we can no longer void. It would then need to be refunded.  
What values map for the terminalID, merchantID, and bin? The documentation site shows details about a soft merchant and then a sub-merchant. Can we confirm if this is what we should be using when sending payments for a particular MID/TID/BIN? Can we also get an example of how the payment flow should work using the Direct API Integration?
https://developer.payments.jpmorgan.com/docs/commerce/online-payments/capabilities/online-payments/payment-methods/cards#soft-merchant-data
 
Documentation is confusing since the API Reference shows the merchantID would be part of the header - 
Online Payments
Chase will confirm the value in the header as they called it a different name. Doc site says merchantID. That would be the mastermid and then the soft merchant and sub-merchant would be the sub details for our billers and their MAID. 
Is there an indicator to specify the payment is a Level2 vs Level3 or is it safe to assume it will run as a Level3 payment when the Level3 data fields are populated? Current SOAP API has a “
pclLevel” 
field where we set it to 2 or 3.
No longer needed. We just send the details and Chase will handle the routing as Level 2 or Level 3.
Pinless debit - do we use the field “
merchantPreferredRouting
” and send “PINLESS”? Is this the same as the “pinlessdebit” bool field? 
preferredPaymentNetworkNameList
 - do we need to send these values? we currently don’t have to send the networks supported on the SOAP API calls. 
No longer needed. Chase will handle the routing as well. We can use the preferred routing if we want to but can leave it up to Chase now. 
IP Whitelisting - Do we need to worry about any IP whitelisting? We currently have to whitelist IPs with Chase in order to process payments. 
Should no longer be needed but Chase will confirm. 
Cut-off Time - Any changes to cut off time for settlement of payments? We currently call “EndOfDay” to settle any open payments. 
Default is 10pm EST and suggested that payments sent from 8:30-9:30pm EST will make the cut off. There is room to customize the cut off time but they need to confirm on how customized it can be. 
Reporting SLA is Merchant End of Day + 14 hours. 
Boarding - How long is the approval process for boarding a client? 
Boarding - Merchant Screening Process - Is this the same as “Onboarding a client” 
 “Once you have sent the merchant's details for screening, they are automatically screened periodically to ensure they are still able to use J.P. Morgan banking and payment services.” Are we notified if the profileStatus changes? Ex. Terminated? Would we see payments decline? 
Payment APIs - Are there any secondary endpoints?

JPM PayFac Questions
FTP Connectivity mentions two environments: CAT and Production. Can we have more than one test account for CAT? For example, we could have a Sandbox, Regression, UAT, etc. 
The IC team can advise the implementation team which accounts are required for testing.
When submitting a NACHA file, are there any acknowledgment and/or response files to confirm that the file(s) were successfully processed? 
A standard ACK will be generated back in response to the payment files sent. I’ve attached examples of the types of response files that can be shared.
A response File is also provided once the file has been processed. The option to send one single file containing the Debits & Credits or send multiple files. Ex: Credit Nacha File, Debit Nacha File
Can we test end-to-end the various scenarios of money movement, return codes, etc.. in the CAT environment? 
Money movement is not tested in CAT. Once migrated to production it is recommended to start with LV test ( .01 etc) to provide the end-to-end result.
CAT environment does support triggering various payment lifecycles such as Returns, NOCs, Chargebacks, etc. The only feature not supported in CAT is the actual money movement scenario. 
==================================================================
RD Notes:
Commerce Center
: The administrative UI that sits on top of the API stack.
Commerce Platform
: The API stack (unofficial name) powering real-time payment processing, replacing Orbital.
Initially planned as a commerce platform implementation, now expanded to include a PayFac  model for IC , transitioning from FLS .
End of Day (EOD) and Settlement
:
Default merchant EndOfDay is 10 PM EST (Commerce standard).
Transactions captured before EndOfDay settle same day; after EndOfDay , they spill to the next day’s batch.
Flexibility exists to engineer API calls to mimic batch processing, despite being real-time.
 Can EndOfDay be set to 11:59 PM EST? Chase says yes (latest possible), but jobs run at midnight, potentially delaying reporting. Chase to confirm custom EndOfDay options available.
Reporting SLA
: Merchant EndOfDay + 14 hours (e.g., 10 PM EndOfDay → noon next day). Typically available earlier (morning), but plan for noon.
PayFac vs. FLS:
FLS: Indirect contractual relationship with sub-merchants, each individually boarded to Chase.
PayFac: IC becomes the merchant of record under a master MID (Merchant ID), managing sub-merchants directly. Sub-merchant data is submitted with transactions.
Hierarchy:
PayFac: Master MID → Sub-merchants (IC manages).
Commerce API: Processing Entity (PE) = MID used in API calls; reporting reflects master MID hierarchy.
Soft/Sub-Merchant Data: Only one MID (master) used; sub-merchant details passed via soft descriptors (Chase to confirm how this appears in reporting).
Implementation Strategy
:
IC eng. interpreted plan
: Build commerce platform to replace Orbital, then develop PayFac separately.
Chase called out the actual plan/vision
: The agreed strategy/plan has been to build commerce platform directly as PayFac to avoid redundant work (FLS → PayFac migration later). IC can phase sub-merchants into PayFac while maintaining FLS operations.
Orbital won’t be sunset immediately; reporting access remains for an extended period.
Boarding Component
:
PayFac requires IC to board sub-merchants via Chase’s boarding API (screening capability included).
In FLS, sub-merchants are boarded to Chase; in PayFac, IC boards them under the master MID, requiring internal process design.
Engineering discovery to begin on boarding apis
Product needs to work with Engineering and Chase to understand where the boarding project should be listed on the roadmap. 
Chase Follow-Ups
Confirm if EndOfDay is time-based (not just amoutn of time) and custom EndOfDay options for commerce platfrm
How sub-merchant data appears in reporting (soft descriptors).
Provide architectural diagram of PayFac flow.
