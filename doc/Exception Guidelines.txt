Exceptions are the primary means of reporting errors in frameworks. Most developers have become comfortable with using exceptions for usage errors such as division by zero or null references. In the Framework, exceptions are used for all error conditions, including execution errors.
✔️ DO report execution failures by throwing exceptions.
✔️ CONSIDER terminating the process by calling System.Environment.FailFast (.NET Framework 2.0 feature) instead of throwing an exception if your code encounters a situation where it is unsafe for further execution.
✔️ DO document all exceptions thrown by publicly callable members because of a violation of the member contract (rather than a system failure) and treat them as part of your contract.
Do
❌ DO NOT return error codes.
Exceptions are the primary means of reporting errors in frameworks.
❌ DO NOT use exceptions for the normal flow of control, if possible.
❌ AVOID explicitly throwing exceptions from finally blocks. Implicitly thrown exceptions resulting from calling methods that throw are acceptable.

Using Standard Exception Types
This section describes the standard exceptions provided by the Framework and the details of their usage.
Exception and SystemException
❌ DO NOT throw System.Exception or System.SystemException.
❌ DO NOT catch System.Exception or System.SystemException in framework code, unless you intend to rethrow.
❌ AVOID catching System.Exception or System.SystemException, except in top-level exception handlers.
Do Not
ApplicationException
❌ DO NOT throw or derive from ApplicationException.
Do Not
InvalidOperationException
✔️ DO throw an InvalidOperationException if the object is in an inappropriate state.
Do
ArgumentException, ArgumentNullException, and ArgumentOutOfRangeException
✔️ DO throw ArgumentException or one of its subtypes if bad arguments are passed to a member. Prefer the most derived exception type, if applicable.
✔️ DO set the ParamName property when throwing one of the subclasses of ArgumentException.
This property represents the name of the parameter that caused the exception to be
thrown. Note that the property can be set using one of the constructor overloads.
✔️ DO use value for the name of the implicit value parameter of property setters.
Do
NullReferenceException, IndexOutOfRangeException, and AccessViolationException
❌ DO NOT allow publicly callable APIs to explicitly or implicitly throw NullReferenceException, AccessViolationException, or IndexOutOfRangeException. These exceptions are reserved and thrown by the execution engine and in most cases indicate a bug.
Do argument checking to avoid throwing these exceptions. Throwing these exceptions exposes implementation details of your method that might change over time.
