Prepare this section for the review meeting
 Problem Alignment
Due to the OBD processing being in a single job, each biller has to wait until the billers ahead of them are finished. The unmatched payments can sometimes take several hours into the morning before becoming available in the biller portal Pending Payments section. Ideally the billers will have access to these first thing in the morning.
High volume of OBD at the end of a quarter can already cause long processing times. Considering our number of OBD billers is ever increasing, this will eventually become a significant problem if it’s not addressed.
We’d like to run multiple instances of the application instead of a single job, which would reduce the amount of time to process the entire run. We plan to implement this in the same way we do Auto Pay (Azure batch).
 Objective
This will reduce the amount of time and number of errors that occur during the RPPS process, which will improve biller satisfaction by allowing them to match payments earlier in the morning. This aligns with the company goal of increasing OBD adoption among existing and new billers in 2023. It will improve performance and allow us to accommodate for larger billers that will be signed in the future without negatively affecting our other billers. It allows us to scale up the system as needed.

 Target Audience
Group
Impact
OBD billers
Billers have to wait until the OBD process finishes before they can go match payments in the biller portal.
Engineering
Engineering has to get involved when the OBD process fails, which takes up valuable time.
Sales
This would give them a better selling point by advertising a quicker time frame to access OBD payments.
 
User Interaction and Design
 Components Impacted
What components within the Invoice Cloud platform will be impacted?
Component
Impact
MC_RPPS application
Check for import completion before running
OBD auto match process 
Reduce processing time to get through entries for a biller
MC_RPPS import process
TBD
Azure batch
Running MC_RPPS application per biller
create batch account
create new pool
Azure batch runner
Pass in skybot job MC_RPPS
 Technical Architecture
The file import process usually takes about 10 minutes to add 15K records to the rpps entries table for each biller found in the files.
High level workflow for new OBD process

 Serviceability/Observability
Log all metric data to NR to create dashboards and reports to gather high level information and craft alerting around key metrics.
After application is deployed, check to see if we hit goal metrics. Compare to prior years to show the improvements.  The past 2 years of data was gathered in a separate endeavor and is available to verify improvement.
Monitor number of errors to ensure this is decreased as expected.  We have a few items on the team that will help improve the error rate.  I talked to the team and most of the errors are usually resolved in 15 min or less.  Some uncommon ones can take 1-2 hours of research and updates/reruns.  We should follow up to make sure this frequency has decreased after release.
For each biller in the months after the release, we should add additional visibility in the biller portal highlighting OBD status and overall progress, payments imported, percentage complete, and Auto-match rate for day/month/year.

Spend 6-8 weeks on this project to allow scaling as we gain more OBD billers over time.
Auto Match process will still consume a significant amount of time and likely needs to be addressed at some point
