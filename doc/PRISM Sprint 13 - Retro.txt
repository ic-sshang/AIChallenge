What Went Well?
What Went Less Well?

What puzzles?
Everyone completed their tasks on time.
Great teamwork in development and automation, along with strong support from the DB team, made the delivery smooth.
Automation PR reviews took time.
Still considering automation as separate from development.
Either we should split dev and automation story or close the story without automation PR merge
