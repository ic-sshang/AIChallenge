Objective
The objective of this spike is to understand and validate the internal email processing workflow involving StratusCommNotification and SystemEmailQueue. Specifically, the goal is to:
Investigate how email data is generated and queued by the StratusCommNotification component.
Confirm the interaction between StratusCommNotification and SystemEmailQueue stored procedure for internal emails.
Validate the records from the queue and sending emails.
Ensure all components are correctly deployed, configured, and integrated in the DevTest environment.
Identify and confirm the Skybot job schedule responsible for triggering the process.
We have validated this in DevTest by adding the email queue in the email template, which allowed us to perform the validation. In the 
Stratus Management
, we have the option to create a new entry by clicking on the 
"New"
 button. When this option is selected, a new Stratus Management record is automatically created, even without adding any initial information.
After creating it, we are expected to edit the record and add the relevant 
Stratus tasks
, including 
BIF files
 and setting the 
interval (e.g., Daily)
. This interval determines how often the tasks are executed.
However, during testing in the 
Dev environment
, we encountered an issue:
When attempting to add a task and save it, the system displays a 
blank page
, and the save operation does not work as expected. We're currently unsure how to properly configure Stratus in the 
Dev environment
, which may be contributing to this issue.
Additionally, for inactive Stratus records, email notifications are expected to be sent out. This process is handled by the 
Skybot job
 named:
StratusCommunicationNotification
These jobs typically run automatically at 9 AM EST & scheduled to run at 
24, 48, and 72-hour intervals
 after a Stratus becomes inactive. When the condition is met, the related email data is inserted into the 
SystemEmailQueue
 table, from which the Skybot job picks up the records and sends out notifications accordingly.
