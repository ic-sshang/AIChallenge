Description
This alert triggers based off of the StratusFileProcessor table in IC_PerfLogging. Each record has a StartedDate, and either a CompletedDate or a CanceledDate. If none of the dates get populated within 30 minutes, an alert will go out saying that files are sitting and not getting picked up on a particular machine. 
Resolution
The most likely issue is that a biller loaded large files, so they are taking a while to process and holding up the queue. 
Check the StratusFileProcessor table in IC_PerfLogging to see how many files are pending: 
SELECT TOP 1000 * FROM StratusFileProcessor WHERE CompletedDate IS NULL AND CanceledDate IS NULL
Filter by the affected machine (for example, App1):
AND MachineName LIKE '%IC-App1%' ORDER BY 1 DESC
Monitor to make sure that files are getting processed. If files are getting processed (even if it’s slow), no action is needed, and you can close the alert.
In the case that files are 
not
 moving, you will need to investigate further.
Go to Skybot and look at the Job History for StratusFileProcessor. Find the latest job run for the affected machine and download the job log. 
Look over the job log and see if any files are causing StratusFileProcessor to blow up before it can finish executing. 
If there is a bad file (example: corrupted), you will need to go into that machine via File Explorer, find the file in question, and move it to the errors folder so that SFP can continue processing the other files.
Find the IP for the server in the linked document below. In the Prod AVD, open File Explorer, right click, and select New → Shortcut. In the location field, enter 
\\{IP Address}
 (example: \\10.0.6.4) and click through to create the shortcut. 
Double click on your shortcut to open the machine folder. It will prompt you to login with a PIN but you will have to click on ‘More choices’ and choose ‘Use a different account’, and then type your IC email and password. 
Navigate into the EDataAppData folder, then go to Files → In → StratusPending → {file type folder}
Cut and paste the bad file into Files → In → Errors
Once the bad file has been moved, SFP should start processing the other files. However, you will need to reach out to Data Services to have them manually put a CanceledDate on the record in IC_PerfLogging for the bad file. Then you can close the alert.
There is also a rare scenario where duplicate records could be inserted into the StratusFileProcessor table for a single file. If you think this may be the case, you can follow step 3 above to get into the machine and check the folder to see if there is actually a file in the queue. If there are no files in the queue, but the record in the table still has no dates, it is most likely a duplicate record and you will need to reach out to data services to mark it as canceled.
