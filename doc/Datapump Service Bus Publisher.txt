Datapump Service Bus Publisher 
Version

Description
This is a .NET worker service deployed in the Biller Kubernetes cluster. It runs continuously, pausing for 10 seconds (tentative) between iterations. The service reads unprocessed Datapump records from Biller shards and publishes them to Azure Service Bus in near real time.
Reads pending record counts from the Datapump metadata table from a centralized database, then connects to relevant Biller shards with updates. 
KEDA 
scaling is driven by the message backlog count fetched using KEDA SQL trigger or based on metrics exposed via biller-datapump-api , enabling the worker service to autoscale according to the message backlog for Azure Service Bus publishing.
Primary Functionality
Publishes the pending datapump records to azure service bus.
Key Features
Optimized Biller Shard Connectivity for Datapump Updates based on Azure Elastic DB Query and Custom .NET fan-out code, Kubernetes-Based Deployment, Worker Service, Dotnet 8, Rebus/Azure Messaging SDK, KEDA.
