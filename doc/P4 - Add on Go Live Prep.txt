Overview


The Go Live prep process provides a final opportunity for the IS to review the final Go Live checklist to ensure that the Add on product is ready to be set live and the Biller can begin using the product. Depending on the Add on, this can include a live production payment made in conjunction with a Software Partner (i.e., Cloud Pay) that will be voided once confirmed payment was received by the CIS and posted as expected.  This Go Live prep ends with setting the Add on live in the production environment.
