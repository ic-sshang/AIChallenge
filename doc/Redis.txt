Introduction
We use 
Redis
 as a cache for our web applications (the UI-based ones, not API’s). Today, 5 apps use Redis. MyIIS, the Biller Portal, and the CRM are the heavy hitters. We also have Redis in the configurations for ICSKYNET and CirrusUtilities, although I’m not sure how these apps use the cache.
To run Redis, we use Azure’s 
Azure Cache for Redis
 offering. This helps keep things simple for us, as we don’t need to worry about the details of hosting our own instances.

Current State
Today, we’ve got a total of 7 instances of Redis running in our environments. Here’s a quick breakdown.

All
Appears to be used by all instances of all 5 applications (MyIIS, Biller Portal, CRM, Skynet and CirrusUtilities). This includes all nonproduction instances as well as production. This is hardcoded in the config files for each app is not transformed during deployment.

The Future Architecture of Redis
Desired Future State:

XAT (standard tier)
PROD (premium tier)

Skynet

Decisions
Biller Portal, MyIIS, and CRM should each get their own instance in prod. CirrusUtilities and Skynet should share a single instance in prod.
All other environments should match prod in terms of which apps get their own instance (not SKU).
