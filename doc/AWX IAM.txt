Overview
AWX access is managed through 
Okta integration
 following InvoiceCloud’s company standards for secure and seamless login. Access is granted via 
Active Directory (AD) groups
 and Platform Team adding users to the right team.
Step 1: Add User to the Correct AD Group
Users must be added to one of the following AD groups depending on the environment and level of access required.
NPD (Non-Production) AWX Groups
ic-iac-awx-readers-npd
ic-iac-awx-developers-npd
ic-iac-awx-admins-npd
PRD (Production) AWX Groups
ic-iac-awx-readers-prd
ic-iac-awx-developers-prd
ic-iac-awx-admins-prd
 Once added, the user will automatically see the 
AWX application in Okta
 and can log in.
Step 2:  Group-to-Team Mapping in AWX
Ideally, AD groups would map directly to AWX teams. However, this functionality is 
blocked by an open bug
 in the 
Ansible AWX GitHub repository
 (reference for context).
As a workaround, we have created AWX 
teams
:
Admins
Developers
Readers
⚠️ Note: On first login via Okta, 
all users are automatically assigned to the 
Readers
 team
 by default.
Step 3: Adjust Team Membership in AWX (If Needed)
After the user’s initial login, 
Platform Team
 members can manually adjust their AWX team assignment:
Move user to 
Developers
 or 
Admins
 team if required.
Keep in 
Readers
 for read-only access.
Step 4: Ownership & Responsibility
Platform Team
 is responsible for:
Adding users to the appropriate 
AD groups
.
Adjusting AWX 
team memberships
 post-login, if needed.
Summary
Add user to the correct AD group (NPD/PRD, role-based).
User logs in via Okta → automatically added as 
Reader
 in AWX.
Platform Team updates AWX team membership if elevated access is required.
