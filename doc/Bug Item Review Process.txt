How to Create A Prod. Engineering Bug Item
 
Every Bug goes over an internal review process - The current reviewers - Sam, Isaac, Richard, and Quinten. 
The review happens on Tuesday and Thursday at 11:00 in one of the breakouts.
They can collectively push back a bug back to more research when they identify any shortcomings. 
In case the submitter is not available to clarify the bug will be moved to the next BugCourt.
The bugs that are reviewed should meet the research quality that we all aspire to.
The current reviewers will come up with guidelines on research quality.
