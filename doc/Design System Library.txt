The InvoiceCloud design system is a comprehensive collection of reusable components developed from a detailed inventory of existing UI elements across the biller and payer portals.
Our goal is to ensure consistency and provide clear direction for building applications within these portals, aiming to standardize all of InvoiceCloud’s products.
Guiding Principles
Inclusivity
: We are committed to creating designs that are accessible to all users.
Utility
: Our components are designed to be functional and practical.
Security
: We prioritize safeguarding user data and privacy.
Consistency
: We strive for a uniform experience across all products.
Accessibility
Our design system adheres to WCAG 2.1 AA standards and is built with accessibility in mind from the start. However, designing for inclusivity requires cross-functional collaboration. 
Product owners, designers, developers, and QA teams must all contribute to ensuring that our products meet these accessibility standards.
The team
We prioritize accessibility at InvoiceCloud. Our front-end and design team leads are certified in CPACC and WIS, respectively. 
Additionally, the entire design team is comprised of IAAP members. Meet the team.
Components
 
The InvoiceCloud design system follows Brad Frost’s 
atomic design framework.
 
It organizes components into reusable building blocks that address specific interaction and UI needs. These range from 
atoms
—such as color, spacing, and typography—to 
molecules
 and 
organisms
, including elements like buttons, selects, and form fields. Each component is designed to work seamlessly with others, ensuring an intuitive user experience.
