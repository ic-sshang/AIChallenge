Title
SSO, MFA, and Third-Party IDP Integrations
Status
Draft
Context
As our organization grows, managing user identities and access across multiple applications and services has become increasingly complex. Currently, users have to manage multiple credentials, which leads to security risks and a poor user experience. Additionally, the lack of centralized authentication makes it challenging to enforce consistent security policies such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
Requirements
Improved Security
: Enforce consistent security policies, including MFA, across all applications.
Enhanced User Experience
: Reduce the need for users to remember multiple credentials, simplifying the login process.
Scalability
: Make it easier to manage user identities as the organization grows.
Integration
: The ability to integrate with third-party IDPs will provide flexibility and support for various external services and partners.  Support for enterprise IDps via standard protocol integrations (SAML, OIDC, etc…)
