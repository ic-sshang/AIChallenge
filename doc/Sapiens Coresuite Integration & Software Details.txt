Web Service
Sapiens Coresuite will send the URL for each invoice as part of the invoice record(custom1) that will be used to pull the Bill images.
Many billers use their own print vendor - these integrations will need to be handled biller by biller. Sales will want to ask the biller who they’re using for document management. For these instances, the biller can provide the PDFs to IC to display or IC may be able to connect via web services to display the images.

CloudPay
Supported
Cloudpay V2 will be used on down payments from Sapiens (PolicyPro). 
Billers may not use PolicyPro for down payments through IC.
Cloudpay V2 will be used for one-time payments from Sapiens (PolicyPro). If agents are making a payment on an existing policy for a policyholder, they will use CloudPay V2 on the policy. 
The user experience for the agent making the payment is the same (only the ‘policy’ itself will be slightly different - either a quote or a bound policy).
CloudStore

**Supported but payments will not be posted systemically. Biller will have to manually post payments.
