What is Azure DevOps?
Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2020 | Azure DevOps Server 2019 | TFS 2018 - TFS 2013
Azure DevOps provides developer services for support teams to plan work, collaborate on code development, and build and deploy applications. Azure DevOps supports a culture and set of processes that bring developers and project managers and contributors together to complete software development. It allows organizations to create and improve products at a faster pace than they can with traditional software development approaches.
You can work in the cloud using Azure DevOps Services or on-premises using Azure DevOps Server. For information on the differences between the cloud versus on-premises platforms, see
