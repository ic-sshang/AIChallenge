Overview
Current
Today boarding emails boarding files for both IC and PSN to engineering.  An engineer is assigned to process the file, copies the file to a Bastion server, imports the file running the ICGBoarding application on the Bastion server, and results are communicated back to boarding.  
Proposed
Boarding uploads the boarding file in the CRM to a Azure Blob Storage.  The ICGBoarding application downloads new blobs for processing on a scheduled interval on the Skybot server, imports the data, and uploads a ACK blob to the Azure Blob Storage.  Boarding can review  ACK blobs using a CRM report.
