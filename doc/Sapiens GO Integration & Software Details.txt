Integration Summary
The Sapiens GO for Workers Comp real-time integration provides a data synchronization solution (formats and web service endpoints) for invoice and customer account records, balance adjustments, ACH rejects, voids, autopay enrollment, paperless enrollment, and bill presentment (via PDF linking) between the Invoice Cloud SaaS Platform and the Sapiens GO for Workers’ Compensation core insurance system. Conveyance files are transmitted, however, through SFTP. The integration design includes the product features and web services required to implement supported user experiences and workflows.
