Project
Improvements to Residuals 
Objective
Update CRM Commissions tabs for increased flexibility for data entry, capture and payments as well as updates to data for manual residuals for finance to decrease time spent on residuals payments. 
Create automated checks and balances to ensure we are paying commissions and residuals correctly by biller, and also audit trails for compliance purposes.

The Problem
There is currently not a place in the CRM to set up all sales commissions and partner residuals that entails the entire overview of each set up per biller, partner, invoice type, bonuses, or decreased rates over time.  This requires sales and finance to complete extra work each month to confirm that we are paying out correctly, whether it’s over or under.  
We need one source of data for all commission and residual items in order to streamline the process, audit and relieve manual work that is currently being created today.

Why: How do we know this is a real problem and worth solving?
There is not a place currently that shows all of the configurations and rates for sales commissions and partner residuals to be added and tracked.  We have to manually keep track of each item if it does not fall within the legacy configurations or there are oddities.  We need to have somewhere to hold all of this data per sales rep and partner, to make sure we are correctly calculating each item correctly each month.  It makes it difficult to keep track of and creates manual work for multiple teams in order to complete this task.  The CRM is not efficient in where each item is kept, and also is missing a lot of data.  We need a centralized location and updates to the CRM fields and database so that reports can be run correctly and lessen the amount of manual work and possible manual errors to complete this task each month.  Commission rates are also being tracked manually for almost all sales reps, plus the report generated from the CRM is not removing removed members, causing more work.
Audience: Who are we building for?
Sales Team
Partners
Finance
High-level Approach
We need to update the current entry capabilities in the CRM by reviewing the current set up, make sure we capture what is no longer used and what is missing.  Meet with UI/UX designer as well as meet with Sales Managers and Sales to confirm we have met needed specifications.  We also need to work with finance to confirm updates that are needed for the monthly residuals and commissions report to identify gaps an create requirements on how we can resolve these issues.
Success
How do we know if we’ve solved this problem?
CRM is the main point of truth for sales and partner rates 
We’re capturing at time of sale various inputs for the partner and residual rates 
Required approval flow from Rev Ops for any exceptions where the rates vary before moving ahead with the contract
Clear audit trails for declining rates 
We can get cost of revenue at a biller level to be able to back out costs from the residual calculation
Finance gets a monthly report that has their dream state of costs backed out with amount we need to pay each partner, properly factoring in declining residual rate
IF WE DON’T DO THIS
We may be underpaying OR overpaying partners as of the beginning of 2023
We may be underpaying OR overpaying sales reps (this may be happening now)
We have manual work that the Finance team will need to continue (takes an extra day of work per month for two people - one to do the work, one to review)
Solution Alignment
Key Features
Phase 1
It was decided during a Sales/Finance meeting that we will just focus on adding the Start and End date for this phase and push most items to Phase 2.  We are also working on some database updates with Ross and his team for finance for the monthly residual reports.  All other items have been pushed to Phase 2, which is TBD.
