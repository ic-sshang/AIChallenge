User Interaction and Design
Data Flow - Invoice
Data Flow - Adjustments
GW REST APIs and IGAPP are used to update the balance on IC with RTDR.
Data Flow - One Time Payment - Down Payment
An Invoice data will be sent to Invoice Cloud on the Fly and a payment will be processed through webservice calls in the background. This is not PCI compliant, however, the option is available for the Biller to use.
Data Flow - Customer Update
Paperless and Autopay changes will be sent via GW REST API. GW can also update the Autopay field via IC webservice calls in the background. 
Data Flow - Payment
All payments will be sent via Data Pump using GW REST APIs. 
Data Flow - Inline Donation Payments
Inline Donations are supported to be sent through Data Pump to Guidewire Biling Center. Guidewire Integration will need to be customized to apply the Donations sent by Invoice Cloud accordingly. 
Data Flow - Void
Voids are processed through a webservice call in the background. The payment information will be sent via GW REST API call.
Data Flow - ACH Reject
ACH Reject information will be sent to GW through their REST API calls. The reject codes provided in GW will be used.
Data Flow - Bill Presentment
GW Rest APIs will be used to reflect bill presentment for the user. 
Payer Experience
Payers will access Invoice Cloud from the Biller website (URL redirect). Payers will use the IC Virtual Site and Customer Portal.
Agent Experience
Agents will be able to make a payment on GW via IC webservices called in the background. This is not PCI compliant. The biller has the option to use IC Products and iFraming to use IC for PCI Compliance.
