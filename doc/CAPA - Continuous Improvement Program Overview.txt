A
ction (
CAPA
) program is a very effective way to improve existing processes and quality.
Improvements in quality, processes and workflows don't happen by accident, and they don't happen by blocking off a large chunk of time on calendars to squeeze it in with all the other competing priorities we all experience on a daily basis.
Improvements happen when a team adopts a culture of continuous improvement.  A shared value system that promotes the belief that 
what is good enough today is not good enough for tomorrow.
The CAPA program will be our vehicle for continuous improvement.  There are many benefits to CI including:
Improved service quality and delivery
Increased team efficiency and productivity
Decreased operational costs - less rework.
Reduced waste.
Significantly increased employee engagement
Happy and referenceable customers!
How does the CAPA program work?
Anytime we have a customer impacting quality issues, or an issue that was caught in process, or go-live slippage, or an idea someone has for a process improvement, log a CAPA ticket in Jira.
PS Leadership will meet on a regular basis, likely bi-weekly or weekly to start, and we’ll review/prioritize the tickets.  We’ll be pulling in team members on specific issues to lend their expertise on specific issues.
Issues will be tracked down to their root cause.  We’ll leverage RCA tools as needed like 5 Whys, Pareto Charts, and Fishbone diagrams.
The goal of CAPA is to implement a program for us to continuously
 Learn, Evolve, and Improve
 from each other’s mistakes.
