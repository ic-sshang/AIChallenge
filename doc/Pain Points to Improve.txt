This is a non-exhaustive list of items that we want to either fix or improve to make our lives and our systems better.

Errors
EQP - losing log files: 
Whenever an EQP job shows 
FileUploadAccessDenied 
in Azure, it means that it was unable to move the logfile to iclogstorage.  That log file is lost permanently.
Token Expiry
Error on ICAutoPayScheduledPayRemindersController. Microsoft.Rest.Azure.CloudException: The 'EvolvedSecurityTokenService' access token expiry UTC time '7/12/2025 8:23:34 PM' is earlier than current UTC time '7/12/2025 8:24:11 PM'.
Alerts
Single biller exceptions call folks in the middle of the night.  There is nothing that can be done 
until AutoPay is done for the day.  On-call will address these errors when they log on for the day.
Biller exception/decline alert.  It is almost always a false alarm since the declines are normal (account closed, expired card, suspicious activity, etc..).

The alert should check if the decline is normal




o   7/11/2025        Completed AutoPay Job Error Detected: The following Billers Exception Rate > 50% or Decline Rate > 50%: Biller: 1692 U.S. Auto Company
Completed AutoPay Job Error Detected: The following Billers have more than 5% failed payments: Biller: 223 Town of Glastonbury
What triggers this?  Almost always a false alarm
Completed AutoPay Job Error Detected: No completed AutoPay tasks in the last 20 minutes!
Mark 
– The trigger is in perflogging database.  SP/SPMulti/AP/APMulti.  Tweak is to bring timer down in logic app.  Reduce overall window to 3:30 – 7:30 central
RTDR auto-disconnect for AutoPay and EQP
:
The AP/EQP jobs should auto-disconnect from RTDR when certain criteria are met.  This is a common source of delayed AP and EQP runs and requires assistance from Client Services.
o   Configurable per biller.  Some billers are very sensitive about RTDR
o   Command line parameter to control it during re-runs
o   
Mark
:  CIRCUIT BREAKER PATTERN – loop in Anita/Cat for thresholds
Alert Improvements
Add time zone and priority to alert text.  Don't make me have to look them up in the CRM:
                Completed AutoPay Job Error Detected:

Mark:  quick db change
In Jira alerts, insert a dash between the run number and the biller id
. 
Easy to mistake the BID for 1287, instead of 287, in an emergency
Before: Job Name: 2025-07-02-autopayschedulepayprocessing-Staging-Med-CT_1287-----InvoiceCloud---QE-287
After:  Job Name: 2025-07-02-autopayschedulepayprocessing-Staging-Med-CT_1-287-----InvoiceCloud---QE-287
Mark:  quick change to the controller
Code Improvements
Receipt pages
 –
Document the flows
redesign/refactor – Carlos and Papa Bill have some suggestions
Better way of re-running AP
Automate the re-run -> have it figure out what’s broken and how to fix.
Manual runs – what information do we need to re-run?  
Make it as easy as clicking single button so that CS can just “click a button”
Have more options via controller or scripts - script to create a schedule
Control what RTDR refreshes for re-runs 
(have it refresh only invoices with a balance instead of zero balances because that may cause double payments) – 
discuss with Cat/Anita
Anitha – separate regular AP runs into RTDR and non-RTDR runs
Run multiple AP’s and EQP’s simultaneously
We should be able to stage an AP/EQP re-run while another run is happening instead of having to wait until the main run finishes.  This takes up a lot of time for the on-call person, particularly during weekends and holidays.
Library Maintainance
IC.Logins – who should own this?  Shared Services
The library is a bit of a mess.  There are two branches, one for Framework and one for Standard 2.0.  Versioning was not consistent in the past.
Break out into separate repos (framework vs standard)
Use correct Semantic versioning – all IC developers should do this
