New Relic Infrastructure Agent Excerpt
Pre+Post-Provisioning 
We use the New Relic Infrastructure Agent to send system metrics and events as well as both system and application logs to New Relic.
Install the agent with MSI installer | New Relic Documentation
Note
: may require injection of license key after deployment. Don’t add sensitive values to the image itself.
While we can install the agent during the image build, we should not include any secrets at that point. We’ll need to inject secrets at runtime.
