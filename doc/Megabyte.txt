Summary
Megabyte integration is real-time using for payments and balance adjustments.  CPV2 is in use for payments directly from Megabyte hosted County specific pages.  CPV2 is also in use for internal cashiering system.  
We do not send Megabyte any enrollments in paperless, autopay, pay by text.  
No address information is sent through the BIF.  This decision was reached due to Megabyte not being able to parse data for address they receive through the assessors office.
