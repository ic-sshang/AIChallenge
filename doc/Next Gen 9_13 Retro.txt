Stop doing
Keep doing
Random Thoughts/Music Request
Have Product representation ++++
Functional Requirements beyond “do what MyIIS does”
Jira workflow does not align at all with how we actually do work
Senior developers need to be allowed to make technical decisions or at least should be taken seriously when we say something is good or bad idea.
Getting proper requirements from the stakeholders
Discussing issues that come with technology/systems/MyIIS
Getting proper requirements
Add stories to the board after grooming completed with the team
Have a story before starting the dev work especially UI work
Permissions to resources.
Allow to make DB changes via Michael
Reverse engineering MyIIS ← this++++++++
moving at a snail’s pace
We are chained to existing methodologies and way of doing things - change can be good, that’s why we’re here
Developers are treated with a one-size-fits-all mentality - i.e., everyone is looked at as a junior developer straight out of school
Prohibited from using the technology solutions that we need to use
Grooming (at least once a week)
Technological Improvements/IC.MicroService framework
making things better - to the level that we are permitted
We have constant problems with people not having permissions to do things we need to do, especially with infrastructure 
^^^see comment about being treated like junior devs
Why can’t we write SQL statements?
Why coffee good?
Why don’t we do any demos? -Primary stakeholders not attending. Difficult to get feedback. 
Action items

 to follow up with Bill/Product about having representation for the team. Makes it difficult for the team to move forward on knowing requirements. Doesn’t have to be Bill, just need someone with product experience. They also need a full time Randy that has the technical understanding.
