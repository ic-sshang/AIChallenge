Role Scopes
Roles can be applied at both the ADO 
project
 and the ADO 
organization
 scope. 
This allows us, for example, to assign a technical lead for the 
Payer
 ADO project the 
ado-payer-approvers
 Role and the 
ado-org-contributor
 Role at the ADO organization scope to allow access to other ADO projects at a lower Privileged level.

Approval Requirements
Application Deployments
Questions to answer:
Should app deployments to 
xat
 require 1 or 2 approvals?
Pretty sure it’s just 1 today. Michael’s notes say 2
Should admins be able to act as approvers? 
Note that admins can 
bypass
 approvals. Doing this shows the check as 
bypassed
 rather than 
passed
 but otherwise don’t affect the run.
The original role definitions notes that overriders should be able to do everything that approvers can do and more. 
We should ensure this is true; I don’t think environment approvals have been configured the same for overriders

We’re ok with anyone approving. The approval is just intended to stop deployments from automatically going to iat after deployments to dev

Infrastructure Deployments
Questions to answer:
really need to audit this list. We never clearly defined that before
should admins be able to approve things? Or should we assume they’ll be added to the approval group if they should be approving?
I lean toward the latter. The Platform team gets org admin, but in general, will not be involved in the application release process and won’t generally act as approvers. 
In projects where Platform does generally act as approvers, i.e. 
Systems_Src
, the team should be included as approvers in the group 
ado-systems-src-approvers

We probably should require approvals here
, as the nonprod hub lives in Sandbox. A sad reality.
