This document lists out thoughts on the functionality to add that may be obvious but may also contain items surfaced when diving deeper into the topic.  In no particular order:
Ability to add/edit Biller Domain details (shard)
Biller Domain name
Looks like we can add to Mailgun over API
Display DNS records that Biller will need to add on their end
DNS record verification view to confirm the DNS records were added correctly
Location to save the auto-created 
smtp
 credentials for that Biller Domain
Username in shard
Password in Azure Keyvault
We will need an appropriate name format as we have 1 keyvault instance per env that will be shared with all Billers that are using this functionality.  Ex: billerdomain_smtppassword_<billerid>
Update ICFramework.Utilities.Email to read this value
Update spam import jobs to read data from Biller Domains as well as the standard ic domains
update do not email import jobs to read data from Biller Domains as well as the standard ic domains
Update the “add to safe senders list” text on existing email templates to intelligently use the Biller Domain if applicable
