Submitter model - InvoiceCloud absorbs the fees and assumes the liability. Service fees are then determined and charged by the InvoiceCloud
In the case of PP and PP brands. we do only send 1 transaction up to PayPal and only record 1 payment on our side when processing PayPal brand payments. however, when paying out, we split out the fees at that point. in the biller portal, the logic to subtract the fees comes from the submitter bit on the terminal which is set to off. This needs to be enabled for this biller on their PayPal terminals and then the exports and reconciliation pages will start to show the correct data
The funding batches will split the fee and the original invoice
use Biller_Shard
select * from Payments where InvoiceID = 58973 order by 1 DESC -- PaymentReference is critical to track down
use ICGW_Master
select top 10 * from Payments where PaymentReference= 'dHJhbnNhY3Rpb25fNHp5bTJ2bW0' order by 1 DESC
select * from fundingbatches where TerminalID=6268
