Notes
Review the next Maintenance Window either Wednesday/Thursday before the Sunday maintenance  at 9:30est so the India team can be present.
As a Platform team, we should take initiative to get more people the knowledge and skills to assist in patching servers
Continue to pause more alerts - engineering-issues-internal channel blows up during maintenance
will reflect the steps needed to achieve this in our patching procedure document
Some of the web servers (1-5) that were kicked off Saturday evening did not fetch the cumulative update initially. Steps to resolve this will also be added to our patching procedure document.
Continue to Try to ensure any scripts that need to run are powershell
Can we kick off second batch of web servers a bit earlier to avoid ending around 10-11 est? They take about 4 hours to finish. This is the second maintenance that goes over due to web patching. Suggesting finishing up the webs saturday night and starting the second batch before bed.
