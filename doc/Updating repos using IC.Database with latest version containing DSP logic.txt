REPOS WITH MI
DEVELOPMENT
Review code that may support testing of IC.Database functionality (GET_DATASET, GET_DATATABLE, EXECUTE_COMMAND_NONQUERY, EXECUTE_COMMAND_SINGLE_RESULT).  Could be unit tests, integration tests, health checks, etc.  These methods will help us validate the version upgrade.
Note that usage of IC.Database is indicated through initializion of class DatabaseProxy
Note that IC.ServiceProxies (not in scope w these updates) could be using IC.Database behind the scenes too.
If neither case shows up, it's possible the repo isn't using IC.Database.  Let's have group discussions on these to offer 2nd set of eyes.
Review code to determine logging method.  IC.Database internally is using the built in NR/Serilog.  We want those logs to write out to the same app log stream.
Upgrade IC.Database library to latest 1.* version (new one coming soon)
Ensure existing test IC.Database methods are green post version upgrade
Gaps in testing of core IC.Database functionality should be filled
One integration test per core method should exist 
GET_DATASET, GET_DATATABLE, EXECUTE_COMMAND_NONQUERY, EXECUTE_COMMAND_SINGLE_RESULT
Add 1 test (prefer in test project) that confirms the IC.Database DSP internal logging is writing out to the same application stream
DSP doesn't like statements where the SP name is in brackets.  You can call the below statement in sql and we expect a log out with the keyword of "SQLParserHelper".  If it exists, that is the confirmation we need.  
ex: [selBillers] @BillerID=301
SUPPORT
Follow standard release procedures
Be available to test/validate code on release night as it goes through environments
Review logs of new runs of that app looking for instances of "SQLParserHelper" logs.  They could be information but might be actionable logs for the future.  Be aware of them.
Review performance and utilization of common resources (cpu, mem, etc) after runs.  We don't expect to see any significant degradation or improvement of performance.  Average is expected.
REPOS WITHOUT MI
Above steps should be followed but additional steps will be required
Validate MI was provisioned properly using Mi Validation tool
Implement MI pattern (config keys, DatabaseProxy initialization, health check for db, etc)
