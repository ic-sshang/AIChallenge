Purpose
This policy outlines the accepted versions of .NET for development and production environments to ensure stability, security, and supportability.
This policy is for .Net (formally named Core).  
 See .Net Framework Version Policy
Scope
This policy applies to all development teams and projects utilizing .NET within the organization.
Accepted Versions
The current accepted version of .NET is 
8.0
.
Only Long-Term Support (LTS) versions of .NET should be used for production environments.
Long-Term Support (LTS) Versions
LTS versions are supported for a minimum of three years, providing stability and extended support.
All new projects must use the latest LTS version of .NET.
Existing projects should be upgraded to the latest LTS version as part of their regular maintenance cycle.
Rule of thumb:  Even numbers are LTS and odd numbers are STS
Short-Term Support (STS) Versions
STS versions are supported for a shorter period and receive updates only until the next release.
Use of STS versions must be approved by an Architect.
Projects using STS versions must have an approved maintenance plan to upgrade to the next LTS version when it becomes available.
Maintenance and Upgrades
Regular reviews of .NET versions in use will be conducted to ensure compliance with this policy.
Maintenance plans for upgrading to newer LTS versions should be documented and a part of a .Net project lifecycle.
