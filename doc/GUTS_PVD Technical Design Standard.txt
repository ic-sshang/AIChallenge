RTDR: Balance Update
Impact:
 Any biller using the GUTS RTDR integration with the {{
CheckRecentPaymentsOnAccount
 }}RTDR configuration.
Expect:
 RTDR should look back for payments for the specified "look back period", and only run if no payments are found. (
Marion County is the only biller using the 
CheckRecentPaymentsOnAccount
 
logic.
 
Need to check every payment type except for Balance Forward (10))

RTDR does not run for invoices if the invoice in question has had a payment within 5 days of the refresh trigger
RTDR does not run for invoices if the payer has made a payment within 5 days of the refresh trigger
The spGutsRecentPastPaymentCountOnInvoice stored procedure may need to be updated to return all payments for the customer. If we find a payment that has been made within 5 days of the RTDR attempt, we should break out of the loop and end the RTDR process

GUTS cannot accept negative number. IC should not include it in export.
Remove refund in payment export.

TBD
RTDR looks back for payments for the specified "look back period", retrieves them and then filters by 
PaymentTypeID
 1, 2, and 4. Payments of a different PaymentTypeId are excluded, resulting in RTDR running.
RTDR should look back for payments for the specified "look back period", and only run if no payments are found.
Remove filtering logic. Check every payment type except for Balance Forward (10), rather than only checking 1, 2, and 4.
