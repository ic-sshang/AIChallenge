 Problem Alignment
Problem Alignment
InvoiceCloud currently only supports English on the payer site. This limitation on our payer site prevents some sales particularly with enterprise prospects. In order to compete we need to provide multilingual options. 
 Supporting Research
Supporting Research
English is still vastly the most prominent language used on our site. The below chart shows the most common languages set in the browser including all English and non English. 
We additionally face a potential problem not having multi-lingual options in iframe. Below are examples of partner portals that support some non English options. As we work with more portal partners using IC iframes we need to reciprocate the payer’s language preference in the portal.
While most  RFPs do not have clauses about multi-lingual options or lack detail we have a few upcoming RFPs that have specific clauses on support languages they require.

 Objective
Objective
The objective of this project is to introduce multilingual to the payer site. We have an opportunity to appeal to more billers by offering a payer site with multiple languages. Some of our existing billers already offer multiple languages on their site (see the below table of our top billers and the language options on their site). However we don’t then support their language selection on our payer site. For example a payer on Narragansett Bay Commission site can select Spanish on the biller’s website however when they continue to pay on InvoiceCloud that language selection does not continue and the payer sees English. 
Our objective is to introduce a high level approach for how we could market and implement multilingual on the payer site so that we can market we have multilingual options.

How much needs to reside in the db vs. code vs. elsewhere
"Naïve" db storage introduces unnecessary duplication for each biller
Centralize sensible defaults / translations
Changes are rare and would require approval, so an "instant" db update isn't critical

 Release Plan 
Release Plan
Releasing the Multi-lingual changes involves getting support from billers to accept the changes on their customizable text and their individual content. We will translate our IC content using manual translation and then we will use automation for translating the biller’s custom content. The biller will have to confirm the changes to their custom content before we switch their whole site to showing a new language option. 
Communication needed: 
email notifying billers of the upcoming change for multi-lingual and steps of what to do. 
biller’s have X timeline for completing approval of new multi-lingual on their site. 
When billers do approve the translations we will need a way to automatically and easily turn the changes on for their site individually.

Multi-lingual Position
Multi-lingual Offering

Not seeing it on City of Wilmington, City of Clovis, or Henrico County.
Kubra
Kubra as standard supports (5) languages across their web platforms including outbound communication. They will add additional languages if required. This is a formal language file and translation process.
•English, Spanish, French, Chinese, Mandarin
We see other portals using an options Google translate with a language selection supporting 10+ languages. IVR has traditionally been just English and Spanish, Kubra does support French for their Canadian customers.
Natural language IVR technology – not multi-lingual, or they do offer bill presentment in different languages – assume they do this on their site too.
Outbound would include SMS, email, IVR, Amazon Alexa, Facebook and paper.

Not introducing global Google Translations across our IC Payer Site as the payer can do this from their web browser.
Allowing language selection on the virtual site, as we won’t have the user registered and their consent for selecting a certain language.
For MVP we will not do translations for all emails.
For MVP we will not do translations for Pay by Text. 
Additional languages besides those preset by partner portal.
Introducing additional languages to IVR.
Bill presentment translation. We will not be supporting multiple bill presentment translations for MVP as this will require the biller to send us multiple versions of invoice PDFs. Instructions on the back of the bill on how to translate. Could we use AI for content generation and use this in PDF? Language selection for PDFs.
Not focusing on multi-lingual needs for Consumer Finance vertical.
