1. Test Overview
We're testing a new feature that allows billers to configure a custom domain for sending system-generated emails (e.g., payment reminders, confirmations, receipts) instead of using the default 
@invoicecloud.net
. This setup involves technical steps and coordination with an IT team. The goal is to understand whether billers can navigate the setup process independently and identify any usability or comprehension issues that could prevent adoption.
2. Objectives & Research Questions
Objectives
Evaluate whether billers can successfully begin the custom domain setup process using the prototype.
Identify points of confusion in the user interface, especially around technical requirements and collaboration with IT.
Assess how well the feature communicates the value, steps, and status of domain setup.
Uncover any blockers that would prevent a biller from initiating or completing the process.
Research Questions
Can billers understand the purpose and benefits of setting up a custom sending domain?
Are the setup steps clear and actionable for a non-technical user?
Do users understand what information they need to provide to their IT team — and how to access and share it?
Is terminology (e.g., DNS, SPF, DKIM, domain verification) presented in a way that is understandable or adequately explained?
Can users recognize what stage of the setup they’re in (e.g., ready to share with IT, pending verification, completed, error)?
3. Participant Criteria
Target Users
InvoiceCloud billers who manage or oversee email communication settings
Comfortable coordinating with internal IT teams
Technical or non-technical roles, as long as they’re responsible for initiating setup
Exclusions
End users (payers)
Billers with no involvement in communication or system settings

5. Tasks & Scenarios
Observation Goals & Intents
Questions
Screen Needed
Understand the participant’s role 
“Would you tell me a bit about your role?”
“What’s your day-to-day like?”
N/A
Understand pain points with current system email
Can you walk me through how notification emails (like payment reminders or receipts) work today for your organization?
Who receives these emails, and how important are they in your payment process?
Have customers ever contacted you about any of these emails?
Have you or your team ever wanted to send system emails from your own domain (e.g., 
yourtown.gov
)?
Why or why not?
What do you imagine the benefits would be?
Are there any concerns you’d have about doing this?
N/A
Tee up prototype
“Thanks — now we’ll walk through a prototype of this new feature. It’s not final, so some things may be rough around the edges. We’d love to hear your thoughts as you go — please think out loud as much as possible.”

 Help us test a new feature for customizing your domain for customer facing emails
Hi [First Name],
We’re working on a new feature that will allow you to send InvoiceCloud system emails — like payment reminders and receipts — from your own custom domain instead of 
@invoicecloud.net
. We’d love your feedback to make sure the setup process is clear and useful.
We’re looking for a few billers to join a 45-minute remote usability session. You don’t need to be technical — we’ll walk you through the prototype and ask for your honest reactions. As a thank you, you’ll receive a 
$20 gift card
 for your time.
Interested? Just reply to this email and we’ll help you schedule a time.
Thanks so much,
[Your Name]
InvoiceCloud UX Team
