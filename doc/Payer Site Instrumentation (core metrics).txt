Problem Alignment
The Problem
Today we do not have consistent Payer-facing metrics that we can use to answer key questions about payer behavior, make decisions, or understand trends.
We need to be able to track, visualize, and report this data on a regular basis.
Why: How do we know this is a real problem and worth solving?
We do not have large-scale, concrete data we can use to make decisions today. Instead, we primarily rely on surveys, interviews, Sales & Ops feedback to make decisions.
Audience: Who are we building for?
Internal decision makers in Executive management, Product, and R&D. This also may help Sales and Ops secondarily to better understand the behaviors of Payers.
High-level Approach
This should be the quick investment and not the complete project to select a new analytics provider and implement. We should be able to quickly tag areas in the Payer flow that we track conversions, improve our tracking of where Payers are coming from, and establish baseline metrics for things such as Payments, Autopay and Paperless enrollments across different segments.
We may not be able to include IVR events in this initial approach due to dependency on IVRTech.
