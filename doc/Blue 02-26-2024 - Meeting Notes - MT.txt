Notes
.Net Upgrade Part 2
Product teams can own the upgrades but what happens when the upgrade is too complicated or there are no tests in place?
Audit Script:
https://dev.azure.com/invoicecloud/Src_Miscellaneous/_git/MiscSupportTools?version=GBmaster&path=/repoSearch.ps1
CRM Web App
CRM continues to cause engineering TOIL. Spend time to discuss migrating to a web app. 
Code check-ins can end up preventing other developers from building the solution 
Does not impact the automated builds
SDET validates unit tests, can catch local build issues (
need to start with a clean clone
) 
Flow is written team SPAM (work best practice)
Incorrect hard references for DLLs in BIN, can cause runtime error after deployed
Lacks good functional test coverage
Biller Portal was migrated (lessons learned), Manny
Is observability in New Relic enough to be able to surface activity changes?
Is the feature branch behind release? 
Visual Studio builds vs msbuild output test differences
Next time it occurs investigate further with group
Pipelines False Positives
Pipelines show all green but there are issues with deployment.
Report pipeline false positive to the platform team do not use work arounds unless pipeline issue can not be resolved.  If it can not be resolved document.
Proxy Services DevTest
Need to discuss next time
At times we lose access to DevTest due to proxy services are down. Tends to cause downtime for everyone for an hour or so.
