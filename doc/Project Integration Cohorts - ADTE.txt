Overview
Use the enhanced Open AI tooling to:
Identify and publish documentation for configurations and external dependencies
Need to copy confluence pages under proper 
Engineering Documentation Systems
Generate “Healthchecks” to test cover the discovered configurations and external dependencies
Generate unit tests for “Healthchecks”
Enhance the deployment pipeline to invoke the “Healthchecks” and use the results to pass/fail a deployment
Generate a Pull Request with “Healthchecks” code changes
 
Tool Demo
 
Workflow
Run AI tooling against the target code repository
Review / validate configurations and external dependencies documentation*
Review PR code changes*
Work the PR; ensure solution will build and deploy*
Deploy the solution to the Dev test environment
Schedule a meeting with SME to approve the PR, review ADO deployment log, and a plan the release schedule
*Review issues and gaps using the tooling and determine value for evolving the tooling based on findings
 
Release Process
Must merge to main (or release)
