Project Phases
Phase 1: Migrate to SecureAuth as our authentication engine
Scope
Functionality
Users should be able to sign in into the Biller Portal through SecureAuth if the respective Biller is migrated to SecureAuth, if not the users should be able to continue to sign in through our Legacy IC authentication.
Process
All billers/users should be migrated to SecureAuth without loss of functionality
Migration should be transparent to users, no testing needed, no major change in process
System should support some billers on SecureAuth and some on legacy IC authentication so we can migrate in phases.
Status of biller authentication engine should be visible to IC employees within the CRM, with relevant dates.
For the Migrated Billers, IC employees will no longer be allowed impersonating the Biller users, and instead will get the capability to sign in with their own IC SSO.
Notable items
Email address needs to be unique 
within a Biller.
 
Assumption
: We can make this happen, need to check with stakeholders
The ability to impersonate biller users will go away, IC employees will authenticate on Okta and transfer into biller portal
 
Assumption
: We can make this happen, need to check with stakeholders
The concept of a “master account” and “support users“ will go away, each user will need to have a dedicated account
 
Assumption
: We can make this happen, need to check with stakeholders
Migration of existing users
Data cleanup
There are 1208 accounts with 
no email address
Many of these are “master account” and can be excluded (see above)
For the non-master accounts, we will need to contact billers to have them provide email address
TODO
: How many billers does this represent? 
 has a list.
There are 11677 
inactive accounts
 
Assumption
: We can exclude inactive accounts from migration
There are 2436 accounts who have 
not authenticated in over a year
 
Assumption
: We can exclude stale accounts from migration
There are 7870 accounts who have 
never authenticated
Out of these there are X users who were created before an year. 
 
Assumption
: We can exclude unused accounts from migration
Note: Some of these may be brand new users who haven’t had a chance to authenticate yet
TODO
: Need to get updated user data which includes user creation date and exclude any created in the past year
There are 
118
 billers with redundant email addresses (after excluding the groups above)
TODO
: How many billers does this represent?
TODO
: Need to coordinate with these billers to update users with unique email addresses
 
Assumption
: We can make this happen, need to check with stakeholders
Process
Phase 2:
 Add MFA as an option for billers to use
Support for which factors?
Phase 3:
 Add SSO support using external IdP
Support for which IdPs?
Phase 4:
 Add additional features
Support single user account across multiple billers (includes use-cases of demo vs live billers, and multi-dept billers)
Support duplicate usernames (unique within a biller identity pool), so users can have their preferred username
Or possibly migrate to email as our unique identifiers, and discontinue the user of usernames?
