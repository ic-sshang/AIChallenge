Biller may have two invoice files - one for standard billing and one for delinquents. File format is the same, only the name of the file differs.
Biller may have different bill image formats for standard vs delinquent bills. By naming the files differently, IC can determine while bill image format to use for display.
Adjustment File

The Adjustments File (aka Customer Balances file) - sent to Invoice Cloud which contains all of the customers' current balances. The adjustment file can be sent as many times as is needed to Invoice Cloud.
