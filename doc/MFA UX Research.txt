Biometrics, location-based verification and techniques that combine several factors are more secure
It’s also a good idea to put time limits on OTPs. Some MFA systems only accept OTPs (one time passwords) within 30 to 90 seconds, and any attempts after that need a new code. 
Businesses can restrict MFA attempts in other ways, too. Some use location data to check if users are in a place they normally access their accounts, like their home or work. Anything outside of these regular locations triggers further verification steps.
Users should also have a limited number of login attempts. 
Making account access convenient is crucial for the overall user experience. One feature that enhances this process is copying and pasting passwords. While turning off copy-paste functionality may seem intuitive to avoid cyberattacks, it keeps users from adopting secure login management practices.
When designing fallback options, each method should be secure enough to prevent unauthorized access but not so cumbersome that it frustrates the user. Fallback options can include backup codes, other communication channels, and security questions.

Methods:
Knowledge factors – something the user knows (PIN, password, security Qs);
Possession factors – something the user owns (smartphone, security token)
Inherence factors – something the user is (biometrics)
Location and time factors – user's location and time during attempted access
Behavior factors – user's unique gestures and behavior
2FA with SMS codes: SMS-based 2FA adds an extra layer of security by sending a unique verification code to the user’s mobile phone. This method ensures that only users with access to their registered phone number can authenticate their identity
2FA with email verification: 2FA with email verification involves sending a verification link to the user’s registered email address. By clicking the link, users prove ownership of their email account, strengthening the security of their online accounts
2FA with an authenticator app: Authenticator apps generate time-based, one-time codes that serve as the second factor in 2FA. By scanning a QR code and synchronizing with the app, users can obtain unique codes that refresh periodically, providing an additional layer of security beyond passwords
2FA with biometrics: Biometric-based 2FA leverages the unique physical characteristics of an individual, such as fingerprints or facial features, to verify their identity. By enabling biometric authentication, users can utilize their biometric data along with passwords for a secure and convenient login process

Masking passwords can cause errors. Offering a show/hide button at login can create a better authentication experience.
possible to do password-less authentication by using biometrics or hardware tokens, social media logins, magic link to log in that is time limited via email or sms, or passkeys (a pair of keys- private on user device held in authenticator, public shared with application, used with a biometric auth)
Consider Mobile App Integration: Integrate with mobile authenticator apps (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy) to provide a convenient and secure way for users to generate OTPs and authenticate themselves.
Invisible MFA is best because users are averse to MFA

Invisible MFA employs various factors such as device recognition, geolocation data and behavioral biometrics to authenticate users seamlessly. This method is designed to be unobtrusive, maintaining the same security level as traditional MFA without requiring any additional user actions. The user authenticates naturally, using inherent factors like facial recognition, location, or device, making the process invisible. The factors are then used in a risk-engine which is often powered by AI risk analyzers to provide real-time risk scores.
