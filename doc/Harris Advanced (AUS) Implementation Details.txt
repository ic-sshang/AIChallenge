ACH Conversion
There are two fields in AUS database for routing numbers, Branch Number and Bank Number.  Bank Number is the Routing Number associated with Banks that have been setup for customers to select from a dropdown when enrolling in ACH.  The Branch Number is the hand keyed routing number by either the customer at the time of enrollment or by the utility after the prenote is run to correct the routing number.  Review with Biller carefully to ensure the process works the same with them.

Invoice Data
Advanced 
Upon request before coding can begin on the IC side
Data is unique/specific to each biller
Ask the biller what format they present their account numbers to customers - Acct-Cust or Cust-Acct. These values are always provided in the same order in the invoice and may need to be ‘reversed’ in IC through Advanced Setting 48 (Reverse Account Number - Acct-Cust/Cust-Acct). If this setting is needed, please advise in the coding request.
AUS Nightly Invoice File Automation: 
Scheduler is required for this automation.  Confirm with biller that they use scheduler currently and if not, do they have it already installed. For a biller who did not have it installed already, to install it required a new server to be spun up. Not ready at the time of go live, so they had to run invoice file as the last few steps of the billing process.
Bill Presentment
Advanced or Biller
See Bill Images section
After Kick-Off Call
CIS can be setup to only present bills for customers who are EBill.  If using AUS PDF Linking and Biller is setup this way this should be addressed early on. The biller will need to let IC know if they will be using REST or SOAP API. 
Example:
No integration standard - unique to each biller
PDF Linking - Sample Biller
: Hendersonville Utility District (BID:1675). See Advanced Setting 20 & 22. (SOAP) 
PDF Linking - Sample Biller: Town of Gilbert, AZ (REST) 
PDF Extraction - Sample Biller
: City of Apple Valley (BID: 1223)
RTDR API - PROD
Advanced
Upon request before coding can begin on the IC side
Data is unique/specific to each biller
Examples (These will vary by biller and which version of AUS they are using):
RTDR Example API- version:

RTDR Example API- version 4: 
https://paymentsv4.mpwonline.com/Director.asmx

Payment Codes
Advanced
Upon request before coding can begin on the IC side
Data is unique/specific to each biller 
Request payment code mapping from biller for IC configuration.
 IC configures the payment codes in the Advanced Settings for each biller. 
AUS refers to these as ‘Payment Method Codes’ or ‘Transaction Codes’. In order for AUS to add config for Payment Pickup, AUS needs access to CIS QA application and DB through SSMS.
Note: When entering Payment codes for AUS billers in Advanced Settings 64/65 it must be all CAPS.  Their system is case sensitive and does not allow for lower case letters. There are default payment codes that are hardcoded unless these advanced settings are configured.
Block CC Flag
Advanced
Upon request before coding can begin on the IC side
AUS will provide this in field 356 of the invoice 
billing/invoice 
file if a customer is blocked from making CC payments. 
For Adjustments/Balances transmitted via RTDR, the AUS "cash only" flag will update the "block ACH" and "block CC" options in IC. There is no separate AUS flag to block only one - this AUS "cash only" flag will block both payment types.
Block ACH Flag
Advanced
Upon request before coding can begin on the IC side
AUS will provide this in field 357 of the invoice 
billing/invoice 
file if a customer is blocked from making ACH payments. 
For Adjustments/Balances transmitted via RTDR, the AUS "cash only" flag will update the "block ACH" and "block CC" options in IC. There is no separate AUS flag to block only one - this AUS "cash only" flag will block both payment types.
