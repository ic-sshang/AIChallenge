dbo.selCommercialBinRanges_TEST
selCommercialBinRangesv2
 
Using a test SP. We will need to roll the code change out together with the SP change or we can maybe have a new SP and have it rolled out… then when code gets deployed it uses that new SP. 
We ended up creating a new SP and rolled it out to dbmaster. NO db changes needed as this will use the new SP when code goes live. 
Yes

Added new biller option 95.
bcg.selCustomerGroupPaymentHistory

Has to go out along code changes. 
spVerifyAccountNumber
 
spVerifyAccountNumber_test has the changes
mcl.selLoginCustomer
dbo.selCustomersByCustomerGuid 
Biller option just needs the “NOT LIVE” piece removed and please add an additional reminder to modify the customer portal grids before enabling the option. 
BCG item added new column to the base SQL since we use the display account number to show in the summary view. Chris confirmed no issues with rolling out. 
spVerifyAccountNumber
 
if all is working can probably be rolled out since it now supports a new optional parameter. 
mcl.SelLoginCustomer 
- no issues just returns a new value
selcustomersByCustomerGUID
