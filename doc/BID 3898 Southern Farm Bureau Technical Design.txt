SFB team has made the decision to leave paperless setting off on Invoice Cloud since all invoice creation and mailing will still be handled by SFB. The paperless setting in IC will not control anything regarding SFB accounts so there is no need to 1) iframe the paperless screen from pmtctr, 2) return the URL/screenpage name and status back to PmtCtr, 3) convert paperless settings on go live, etc. Paperless has been turned off on Invoice Type Settings and Data Pump Management. 
SFB has decided to use AgentConnect for their Customer/Insured login experience instead of SAML SSO/SSOConnect.
