Ticket Status: Deployment Queue
RFT Status
:
When a ticket reaches the 
Ready for Testing (RFT)
 status, it undergoes testing.
After successful testing, the ticket moves to 
Final Review
.
Once the final review is completed, the ticket is moved to the 
Deployment Queue
.
Fix Versions
:
When a ticket is moved to the deployment queue, the manager updates the fix versions.
Fix versions are determined based on the upcoming release schedules.
Release Schedule
:
US
: Releases are scheduled for Tuesday and Thursday.
India
: Releases are scheduled for Wednesday and Friday.
Time
: 7:30 AM local time.
This schedule is followed every week to ensure consistency.
Build Pipelines
Process
:
Once changes are merged into the Main or release branches, provide the pipeline details to the team in the Slack channel (
#releases-prod-engineering
).
A member of the release team will ask for updates on the pipelines.

The release team deploys the tickets to production.
Monitor the deployment process to ensure it goes smoothly.
Post-Deployment
:
Perform smoke testing to verify that the changes are working as expected.
Smoke testing involves checking the critical functionalities to ensure they are operational.
Smoke Testing
Objective
: To quickly verify that the major functionalities of the application are working after deployment.
Steps
:
Execute a predefined set of test cases that cover the critical functionalities.
Ensure that there are no major issues or blockers.
Outcome
: Confirm that the deployment was successful, and the application is stable.
Test Evidence
Purpose
: To document the results of the testing process.
Steps
:
Capture logs, screenshots, or any other relevant evidence during testing.
Attach the evidence to the ticket in the tracking system.
Ticket Resolution
Criteria
: The ticket can be resolved if:
There are no errors, failures, or issues with the changes.
All testing has been completed successfully.
Steps
:
Update the ticket with the test evidence.
Mark the ticket as resolved in the tracking system.
Database Change Process
1.Initiating Changes
If changes are required on the database side, we must create a detailed database task with clear explanations. 
The task will then be assigned to the database team for review. Once the database team accepts the task, they will begin working on it.
Root Cause Analysis and Resolution
For issues related to the database, we need to identify the root cause and fix the problem. Once the fix is verified, the necessary changes should be documented and provided to the database team.
Development and Testing Workflow
After the database team completes their changes, request deployment to the development/testing environment.
Once deployed, developers should thoroughly test the changes to ensure functionality.
Upon successful developer testing, the testing team will test the changes in the test environment.
Regression Testing
After the testing team completes their testing, request the database team to deploy the changes in the regression environment.
The testing team will perform comprehensive regression testing. If all tests pass successfully, proceed to the next step.
Deployment Queue
Submit the ticket to the deployment queue.
Notify the database team of the deployment schedule. On the release day, coordinate with the database team for the complete deployment.
Production Deployment
Following production deployment, if necessary, perform testing in production using test shards.
Once verified, resolve the ticket and provide all relevant testing evidence.
