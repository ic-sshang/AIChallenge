@Scott Miller
Blazemeter
Barracuda Traffic - 
 to be determine what is scaled down factor to use
Test cases
NewGen:
Functional test cases - Selenium - Tooling Cluster
Nonfunctional - load test - Blazemeter
Legacy:
Functional test cases - Selenium - Legacy Selenium Cluster
Nonfunctional - load test - Blazemeter
Classify Blazemeter test cases - Prework - Aaron/Scott and then review with larger team
Parameters to be monitored and analyzed -
