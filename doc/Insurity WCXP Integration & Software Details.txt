Invoice 
BIF
IC Web Services
Review the BIF file mapping for search criteria. The IC ‘account number’ field is populated with the Insurity WCXP ‘InsuredUnitID’ which is not exposed to most policyholders.
Insurity suggests two values for search: IC ‘invoice number’ (Insurity statementID) or IC ‘account number' (Insurity insuredunitID). In both cases, it’s likely that the biller will need to add the value to the bill image (they can do this themselves)

 to apply BIF customizations (specifically Balance Forward) to CloudPayv2 invoices
NOTE: 
In the case of Self Reporting accounts, if the payer/employer enrolls the account in autopay during payment, autopay won’t actually run in the future. The payer/employer has to log in and manually take action for any invoice to be generated so there would be no future invoice automatically created on IC to run autopay.
