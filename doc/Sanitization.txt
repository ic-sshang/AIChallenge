Validate Input Early and Often
Perform input validation as soon as data is received from the user. This helps prevent malformed data from entering our system.
Use Allow List Validation
Prefer allow list validation over deny list validation. Allow list validation ensures that only known good data is accepted.   Write regular expressions to match for the data that is allowed and not for data that we do not allow.
c#
public bool IsValidUsername(string username)
{
    var regex = new Regex("^[a-zA-Z0-9]*$", RegexOptions.None, TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(1000));
    return regex.IsMatch(username);
}
Use Parameterized Queries
Always
 use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
