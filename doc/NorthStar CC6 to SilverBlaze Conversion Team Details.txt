 Process
Definitions
CC6: Legacy NorthStar Customer Care version 6 used for autopay processing.
CIS: Customer Information System, in this case NorthStar.
SSO: Single Sign-On, allowing users to access multiple systems with one login.
SilverBlaze (SB): Customer portal platform integrated with NorthStar for SSO functionality.
iFrame: An HTML element used to embed another document within the current page, used by SilverBlaze.
Key Responsibilities
InvoiceCloud: Coordinate data conversion and CRM updates; validate SSO functionality.
NorthStar: Provide account, email, and password data for registered users; manage re-registration communication with billers.
Project Manager: Ensure test system validation and Go Live readiness.
Quality Assurance
InvoiceCloud: Verify that customer data is correctly loaded and accessible via SSO in the test environment.
NorthStar: Ensure that account data provided is accurate and complete for conversion.
Project Manager: Confirm that all stakeholders are aligned on re-registration requirements and Go Live timing.
Roles
Biller: The utility or organization being converted from NorthStar CC6 to NorthStar with SilverBlaze.
InvoiceCloud: The payment platform provider responsible for CRM and SSO integration.
NorthStar: The CIS provider managing customer data and SSO integration.
Project Manager: The individual overseeing the conversion process and coordination
Procedure
1. Review Conversion Requirements
Who: Project Manager
Review the guide and lessons learned from previous conversions (e.g., City of Shelby) to understand the technical and procedural requirements.
2. Validate Account Format
Who: InvoiceCloud
Ensure that NorthStar account numbers follow the correct format (e.g., XX-XX to XXXXX-XX) and do not include leading zeroes.
3. Coordinate Re-registration
Who: NorthStar
Inform the biller that customers must re-register on the new NorthStar/SilverBlaze platform. NorthStar manages this communication.
4. Prepare Data Conversion
Who: NorthStar, InvoiceCloud
NorthStar provides a list of account numbers, emails, and passwords for previously registered customers. InvoiceCloud prepares to load this data using the CRM tool.
5. Test System Validation
Who: InvoiceCloud
Perform the data conversion in the test system first. Validate that SSO login, password reset, and iFrame functionality work as expected.
6. Go Live Preparation
Who: Project Manager
Confirm that all systems are ready for Go Live. Ensure that customer data is synchronized and that all stakeholders are informed of the launch timeline
