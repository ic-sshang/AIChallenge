Purpose
To ensure the reliability, availability, and performance of web applications and APIs by implementing standardized health checks.
Scope
This applies to all web applications and APIs developed and maintained by the organization.
Health Check
Verifies if the application or API is running.
Ensures that all critical dependencies (e.g., databases, external services) are operational.
Implementation Guidelines
Endpoint Creation
:
Create a dedicated endpoint ( 
/health
) for health checks that supports the HTTP GET METHOD
Ensure the endpoint returns a status code of 200 for healthy and appropriate status code 500 for unhealthy state.
Response Format
:
Use a consistent response format (e.g., JSON) with clear status indicators.
Example response:
json
{
  "version":"0.1.13+ddb9bfaa025e03379388ad84dc5017d6eae5d805",
  "buildDate":"2024-12-13T21:45:58+00:00",
  "serverDate":"2025-01-24T19:21:44.3305307+00:00",
  "uptime":"5 hours 6 minutes 57.281 seconds"
}

Monitoring and Alerts
:
Integrate health checks with monitoring tools ( New Relic ) to provide real-time status updates and alerts..
Documentation
:
Document the health check endpoints and their expected responses in the web application or API documentation.
Best Practices
Guard Against False Positives
: Implement retries, timeouts, and fallbacks to avoid false positives
Regular Testing
: Periodically test health check endpoints to ensure they are functioning correctly.
Scalability
: Ensure health checks are efficient and do not introduce significant overhead.
