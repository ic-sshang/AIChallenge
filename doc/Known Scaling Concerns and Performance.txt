Initial discussion on 2/26 to discuss areas of concern in our platform if we scale biller count and size significantly..  second, what investments are needed to effectively performance test
Known areas of contention 
Scale - wide
OBD
SMS
EmailQueueProcessing (notifications, settlements)
Batch-close - synchronization
DB shard scaling - multiple DBs needed
Anything with multi-shard query
Everything accessing the DB will need to be updated to support multiple DBs.
 
Scale - Biller
File import time / handling
Batch-Close - synchronization single biller
Reporting datasets - exposure in webservices returning large datasets
Inconsistent quota for DBs - single DB can consume pool resources. 
Account linking at scale. 
UX - investigate biller portal pages for large result sets. 
customer locator search
 
Scale either
Difficult to scale infra wide in Web/Proxy/App.
Web/Proxy to be solved this year.
APP target is K8s but no plan at this time to actively migrate
Azure Functions have scale limitations in current config - needs more investigation.
Existing tests fail under minimal load
  
Possible areas of concern
keyvault
Datapump - streamlined multi-shard and mult-threading available but could be exposed depending on growth / concentration
 
In order to do performance testing 
Test tool -  JMeter  - More folks trained performance testing.
Need tooling to test jobs.
Functional parity in lower environments. - target 1 of existing 4 lower env.. Regression vs build another.
Separate Azure SQL virtual instances required for each lower environment. - in plan for 2025. 
Must be able to create test data at scale - create 5k shards, populate the test data.
Actions
Current test cases fail at scale - Martin and Lakshmi researching why. 
Actions - Go through list of skybot jobs to determine what jobs could be at risk - Tony.
