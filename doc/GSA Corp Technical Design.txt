Summary
GSA Systems is a real estate and personal property tax platform for multiple states that will generate BIF files for various tax bills, which will all use various invoice types at Invoice Cloud. The County websites and the GSA Cashiering system will use CloudPayV2. Balances are refreshed using RTDR, and payments are posted using Datapump. This will be a mostly REAL TIME Integration.

User Experience Integration
This section documents the initial, recommended user experience design for this integration. Since user experience integration uses Invoice Cloud web services that are available to a Biller, it’s possible for the Biller to change at any time without notifying Invoice Cloud after Go-Live how they use our web services.
Cloud Payments V2
Purpose/Summary: This web service based payment integration allows 3rd party applications to utilize a "Pay Now" button within their application to redirect the user to the Invoice Cloud Payment Route where they can enter in all the payment information and submit the payment. Once the payment has been approved, the IC Payment Route will display a printable receipt and provide a method to return the user back to the calling application.
Use Case
Cloud Pay v2 is used to redirect both registered and guest users from an external platform directly to the Invoice Cloud payment route. 
Link to an existing account/invoice
 Invoices have been previously loaded to Invoice Cloud, but the user searches for an invoice on an external customer-facing portal and needs to be redirected to the account and bill for the Invoice Cloud payment route.
