Random Thoughts/Music Request
Tink Library & Bouncy Castle SPIKE items were completed. +1
More knowledge earned by doing research on those items (above bullet) +1
BillerFTP projects deployed to production +2
Some missing tickets were deployed
Testing the IC.DigitalWallet changes on test1 takes a lot of time while loading.  +2
Appropriate test environment not available for Tink projects
Testing is getting more complicated than the  developments. It is more challenging  to test than to codify the changes.
No existing Xray TCs for IC.DigitalWallet
The team requires access to artefacts such as pipelines and repositories that are needed to complete the implementation of  PBIs . Currently, extensive testing is conducted  on each PBI to avoid any potential issue.
The Team's recommendation is to create some test lab environments with all applications configured to enable a smooth and effective testing process.
