ReimbursementProcessor 
The 
ReimbursementProcessor
 has 3 main methods:
Refund - This method will retrieves payment information by the given 
PaymentReference
 in the request. Once we validate that the payment is refundable we use the 
PaymentType
 to select the Refund Strategy. 
Refund Strategies:
ACHProcessorRefundStrategy
 - ACH transactions are scheduled to change status and have a blackout window during which payments cannot be refunded nor voided. Depending of when the payment was made, the status of the payment might indicate that the payment is not currently refundable. This strategy uses 
ReimbursementWindow
 to determine if the current process is within the blackout window, and whether the refund can be queued to process after the blackout window. If everything checks out the payment will get refunded, else the refund gets queued or we return a message that the payment is currently not refundable.
