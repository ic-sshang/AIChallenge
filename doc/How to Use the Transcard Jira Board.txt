Please submit any RAID items and feature requests that Transcard is responsible for on your project to the Transcard Jira project board. To submit a ticket, click on the “Create” button either in List or Kanban view. When submitting a ticket input the required fields for the appropriate ticket type below and assign to Chris Faria. He will then review the ticket details in advance of the next Transcard Jira Project Review call (Mondays 1-2pm ET). You will be expected to attend and answer any clarifying questions for your ticket(s) and prioritize accordingly.
Following each Transcard Jira Project Review, Chris holds a weekly call with Kristin Stevens (Project Manager at Transcard) on Wednesdays to review the project board and capture updates in each ticket. Implementation team members should continue to attend the weekly Transcard Jira Project Review calls until their tickets are resolved.
