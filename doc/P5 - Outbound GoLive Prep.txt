Overview


Overview


The Go Live prep process provides a final opportunity for the IM to review the final Go Live checklist to ensure that the product is ready to be set live and the Biller can begin using the product. 
This can include a live production payment made in conjunction with a Software Partner (Transcard) that will be voided once confirmed payment was received by the Core System Provider and posted as expected.  
This Go Live prep ends with setting the project live.
Transcard Contacts and Roles can be found
