Paperless
Supported - See Details
Some Consumer Finance organizations (ex: US Auto) do not mail bills/statements each time a payment is due. In this case, paperless must be turned off so that customers are not mislead to think that if they are not enrolled in paperless, they will receive a paper bill/statement. This detail should be discussed with the biller.
Partial Payments
Supported
in BIF 
Past Due
Not Supported
Note: The Past Due field is not supported but accounts that are considered ‘past due’ do exist and IC does receive the past due balance. See the BIF file mapping for how the ‘past due’ balance is calculated and passed to IC in the balance field(s)
