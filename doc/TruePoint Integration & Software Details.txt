Note: For CSR payments, CSRs will use CloudPayV2.
Check Free - FISERV - Cash
Supported  
Only supported if biller uses our Online Bank Direct Product. 
This product would be used if municipalities allowed coordinating bill pay with customers banks. A payer will setup a recurring payment or autopay using their bank account and the bank sends over the paper check via FiServ to be applied to the customers account in IC.

CloudPayV2 is used in three scenarios:
Payer initiated: Guest payment - redirects user to IC for the guest payment route.
