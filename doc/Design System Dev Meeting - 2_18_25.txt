Discussion
Recapping PoC progress
Modern JS & module federation
Discussing page by page vs “chunk” method, history of decisions 
Previous page by page approach was super slow due to the extra api’s that had been built 
Thinking a smaller per component migration would be faster and more elegant 
Environment specific config
Need to move in the direction of a single config, inject environment specifics at build
