Purpose
The OBD AutoMatch Controller was created as part of an initiative to facilitate and expedite the OBD automatch process. At the time of writing, the OBD automatch process runs as part of a console application (MC_RPPS) which is kicked off by skybot as a job. The application runs through OBD billers one at a time in a sequential order. Although many improvements have been made to increase the application’s efficiency, the increasing number of billers and payments has led to the degradation of its performance. Thus, an effort was made to remove the automatch process from MC_RPPS and have it run as a batch job in Azure. The migration will allow the automatch process to run on multiple compute nodes (VMs) in parallel and increase the efficiency of the overall OBD Process.
The OBD AutoMatch Controller’s purpose is to create an Azure Batch Job that kicks off multiple tasks on multiple compute nodes. Each task will represent an OBD Biller and is responsible for executing the OBD AutoMatch Process on the compute node it’s been assigned to run on.
Overview
                The OBD AutoMatch Controller application is currently installed on the “icbatchtest” Batch Account which can be accessed through the Azure Portal. Along with the application, a Pool “OBDControllerPool” and Job Schedule “OBDAutoMatchController” have been created. A Pool is basically a collection of compute nodes or virtual machines that applications run on. The controller has one dedicated node to run the controller application. The Job Schedule specifies when to run the job and has the option of specifying a job manager task. The job manager task contains information like: Environment Settings, Command Line (use to kick off application), and application packages needed to create the task.
