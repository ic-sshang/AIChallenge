Question of the week:
 
If our team was turned into a video game, what would be the objective, and what special abilities would each team member have?
DevCooks: The Product Launch Rush!
Like 
Overcooked, the team 
must work together to launch a successful digital product. Instead of cooking food, players are building features, fixing bugs, and meeting client demands, all under tight deadlines.
The goal is to juggle various tasks such as designing features, coding functionality, and managing client requests, while navigating obstacles like changing requirements, technical bugs, and stakeholder feedback. Players must coordinate and communicate effectively to finish tasks before time runs out.
1. 
Task Stations
Each team member has specific "stations" they must interact with to perform their tasks:
Design Station:
 The Product Designer uses this to create mockups, adjust layouts, and fix design flaws.
Coding Station:
 The Front-End Developer codes features, fixes bugs, and ensures the product functions across different platforms.
Management Console:
 The Senior VP can check the project timeline, communicate with clients, and allocate resources like more time or extra team effort.
2. 
Time Pressure and Challenges
The team is racing against the clock to complete a product sprint. Each project has a set deadline (represented as a timer on-screen), and every task (designing features, coding, testing, etc.) takes time to complete.
As the team works, new challenges emerge:
Feature Creep:
 Stakeholders might demand last-minute features, forcing the team to adapt.
Bugs and Glitches:
 Random bugs appear in the code, and the Developer must fix them before they crash the product.
Stakeholder Requests:
 The Senior Manager has to handle sudden client calls, where they might demand changes or provide feedback that can alter the team’s focus.
User Feedback:
 Users will offer feedback that requires rapid design iterations or bug fixes, often introducing new challenges mid-project.
3. 
Levels and Stages
Each "level" of the game represents a different phase in the product development lifecycle:
Level 1: Initial Design Sprint:
 The team works to draft wireframes and early prototypes based on initial client requirements.
Level 2: Development Phase:
 The Front-End Developer codes the core functionality of the product, while the Product Designer refines the UX.
Level 3: Feedback Frenzy:
 The team enters the testing phase, where virtual users give feedback that the team must address in real-time, often throwing off the initial project timeline.
Level 4: Final Launch:
 The final phase, where the team rushes to polish the product, fix remaining bugs, and get the sign-off from stakeholders for the product’s launch.
4. 
Obstacles and Power-Ups
Obstacles:
Deadlines:
 Each level has a strict deadline. If the team fails to complete the project within the time limit, the product could fail.
Scope Creep:
 Stakeholders randomly introduce new feature requests that add pressure to the team, forcing them to manage time effectively.
System Crashes:
 If the Front-End Developer doesn’t fix bugs in time, the system might crash, forcing the team to restart from the last checkpoint.
Power-Ups:
Time Extensions:
 The Manager can sometimes negotiate extra time with the client, allowing the team to finish up essential features.
Speed Boosts:
 The team can use power-ups that temporarily increase their speed at completing tasks, allowing them to catch up when time is tight.
Client Satisfaction Bonuses:
 If the Senior Manager negotiates well with stakeholders, the team gets a temporary productivity boost or an extended deadline.
