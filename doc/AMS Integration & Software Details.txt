Edits like phone and email are batched up and are given to AMS in a single file (a change log file).  AMS applies them to a copy of their data and then give it to the client to apply them to the client e-series.  Change log is posted daily.  There can be a timing issue where i-series produces the invoice file, before it gets the change log edits. If the client does not see changes updating PayConcierge, then ask if they are using the true email and phone fields or if they are just using another field to populate email or phone. Those fields need to be in the right place in order to update correctly.
A change log file can also be sent to the print vendor if needed.

Spool file - as a last resort, IT can use the biller's "spool file" (transferred via an IC FTP) to present a bill image (note: this bill image IC is able to create may not look anything like what's mailed to customers)
