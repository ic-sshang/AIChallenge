Introduction
“
Data pump sends the transactional data (not only restricted to payments) in near real time to customer’s (Billers) or to Customer Information System (CIS) or Software Integration Partner’s API.
”
At a high level
Data pump is a console application which talks with biller’s / Software integration part’s API
It is a unidirectional process (a Synchronization service) i.e., from InvoiceCloud to Biller
As of today, Data pump posts to biller/CIS (the number represents Datapump type ID)
PaymentProcessing = 1
PaperlessSync = 2
AutoPaySync = 3
AchRejects = 4
Registrations = 5
CustomerChanges = 6
AutoPayMethodChange = 7
Chargebacks = 8
ScheduledPaymentProcessing = 9
ScheduledPaymentChanges = 10
PayByText = 11
Pending = 12
AutoPayMethodDetailChange = 13
Void = 98
Why we need Data pump synchronization
Consider an example
Customer with account number XXXX has an invoice of $100
Value at Biller’s system will be $100 & value at InvoiceCloud will be $100
Customer makes a payment of $25 at InvoiceCloud
Value at InvoiceCloud system is $75
Value at Biller’s system $100, as information is not in sync with InvoiceCloud data
Data pump will trigger the Post Payment process and will call Biller’s / Integration partner system API to post the payment details.
Details after posting (or sync)
InvoiceCloud - $75
Biller’s system - $75
