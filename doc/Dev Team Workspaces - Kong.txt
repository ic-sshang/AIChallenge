Kong Developer Instance: Workspace Strategy for Development Teams
Overview
To support decentralized API development and routing, each development team will be assigned a 
dedicated Kong workspace
 within the shared 
developer instance of Kong Gateway
. This setup allows teams to independently manage their own services, routes, plugins, and consumers while maintaining isolation and governance.
Workspace Structure
Each workspace represents a 
logical boundary
 for a development team. Within a workspace, teams can:
Define their own 
services
 and 
routes
Apply 
plugins
 specific to their APIs
Manage 
consumers
 and credentials
Monitor traffic and logs independently
Note:
 Workspaces do 
not share configuration
 across boundaries. Plugins, consumers, and credentials are scoped to the workspace unless explicitly replicated.
Key Components and Nuances
1. Services
Each team registers their 
backend web server
 as one or more Kong services.
Services are scoped to the workspace and cannot be accessed from other workspaces unless exposed via a shared gateway route.
2. Routes
Routes define how incoming requests are matched and forwarded to services.
Teams can configure custom paths, methods, and host-based routing.
Routes are workspace-local and must be explicitly defined per service.
3. Plugins
Plugins (e.g., rate limiting, OAuth2, logging) are applied at the 
service
, 
route
, or 
consumer
 level.
Global plugins
 apply only within the workspace.
Teams must configure plugins independently; there is no cross-workspace inheritance.
4. Consumers
Consumers represent clients or applications accessing APIs.
Each workspace manages its own consumer registry.
OAuth credentials
, API keys, and JWTs are scoped to the workspace and 
cannot be reused across workspaces
 unless manually replicated.
5. Global Credentials Limitation
The 
global_credentials
 setting in plugins like OAuth2 applies 
only within the same workspace
.
If a consumer needs access across multiple workspaces, credentials must be provisioned separately in each workspace.
Developer Workflow
Workspace Provisioning
Admin creates a workspace for each team.
Automated workspace provisioning via Terraform
Teams are granted admin access to their workspace only.
Service & Route Setup
Teams register their backend services.
Define routes for API endpoints.
Plugin Configuration
Apply necessary plugins (e.g., auth, logging, rate limiting).
Configure plugin settings per route/service.
Consumer Management
Register consumers and issue credentials.
Monitor usage and revoke access as needed.
Governance & Best Practices
Naming conventions
: Use consistent prefixes (e.g., 
teamA-service1
) to avoid conflicts.
Security
: Use scoped credentials and avoid hardcoded secrets.
Versioning
: Use tags or labels to track API versions.
Future Enhancements
Shared gateway routes for inter-team API consumption.
