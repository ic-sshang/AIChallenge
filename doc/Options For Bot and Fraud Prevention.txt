Chase Safetech

This would be an API hit that precedes payment processing, it would return a risk rating based on configurable criteria, and we would use this info to decide if we want to proceed with payment auth.  Chase expressed confidence that Safetech would address the issues we’re seeing.
 is seeking pricing information from Mark at Chase.
Also pending discussion which team (WT vs ATK) would take this on.
All things being equal, we feel this option would be a faster implementation timeline than Spec
We should look at alternatives to Safetech, if nothing else to have another option in our pocket for if Safetech can’t deliver what we need

Demo scheduled for Wed 7/10, more details to follow

Ray/Ramesh taking lead on implementing this
Pricing is TBD - Ray/Ramesh
Implementation is fast, had it before, may just need to re-enable it.

reCaptcha or Turnstile or ?

Unsure on our reCaptcha position, checking in with Zach/Security.  Turnstile seems to be a popular alternative, but we need to know more.
Tony confirmed bots are bypassing current reCaptcha implementation
Data monitoring
MED
LOW
Is there possibly some data monitoring and automated prevention that could be implemented in the data layer?  
Decline rate monitor has been updated in WT project.  Working with Gary to create a tableau dashboard to highlight potential risk payments and this has already identify problem billers.
Primarily for visibility and alerting, no current plans to leverage this for preventing fraud.
Auto temp IP block
LOW
LOW
 
The Tendies deployed an item which will enable monitoring around IP velocity.  It is currently only set to monitor and post to our New Relic system to show us possible activity as we are still adjusting thresholds and don’t want to accidentally decline legitimate traffic.  We can configure the lookback time, amounts to watch out for and transaction counts on this logic.
 will keep us posted on what the findings are and how effective we think this approach could be.
Also need to understand how this overlaps with what Cloudflare could do.
Update: 8/22/24 -
 Angie confirmed with Adrian that we are monitoring only. We have not received any alerts so an item was created to review/adj thresholds.

Update 9/24/24: 
EBPP-22941 Fraud alerts are being modified as alerting is currently false positives.  Confirmed no additional fraud has occurred since min field was added. 
AVS & CVV code verification 
MED
LOW
 
In various successful transactions, the testers completely failed AVS verification so enabling this would have stopped them and returned a decline.
Is there a concern around raising declines on otherwise good transactions, or lowering conversion rate by requiring these values?
Sara, Liana, and Adrian had been trying to enable and test this via the Chase Virtual terminal, however, Chase has been less than helpful in getting us the access we need.
  to assist with Chase.
7/10/24 Update:
 We now have access and Liana has turned on AVS for G status (no match) for test BID 1091. We will monitor and team should discuss whether we should we add all billers or specific billers. 
7/19/24 Update: 
 We (Martin/Randy/Adrian/Kelsey/Angie) discussed disabling the G match payments to address the fraudulent test auth's. After looking at the data, there is a chunk of valid payments that are coming thru as a G. We don't feel that we should block the G's at the Chase level because we would inadvertently block valid payments which would be an issue. We would like to discuss some options with the larger team. If we are going to block payments, we should do it on our side and base it on additional criteria to ensure we only declining the fraud transactions. (ie we look at payment source, amounts, etc.) Let's plan to include this topic in our next meeting.
Update: 8/22/24 
- Angie to schedule a meeting to discuss how we should handle the scenario above. 
Update 9/25/24 - 
I confirmed with Vicki there have not been any additional examples. We will not be scheduling a meeting at this time. The solution mentioned above would require a pretty heavy lift to develop something internally and since the fraud has stopped, we are holding on this for now. 
Update 9/25/24 -
 The WT has done some additional research. We are adjusting the risk alerts because the alerts we are getting are false positives. The team has confirmed that we have 
not 
received any additional fraud test cases since we added the min for the 2 billers impacted.
