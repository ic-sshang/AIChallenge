Documentation 
Martin Henderson
https://invoicecloud.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ED
 
Break down documentation by higher product business functions; like “Payment Processing”
Adding documentation acceptance to Blue team function
Comala App - Documentation management / approval
Dev Support run books, move them into Engineering Documentation
.Net Framework Versioning 
Miguel Abagat
How are we forward-thinking of .NET Framework version End-of-Support. If I am correct majority of our repos/projects are in 4.5. In 2 years, .NET 8 Framework will reach it's end-of-support (this will be the last version .NET Framework). After that it will all be .NET Core.
Base on what I known so far, one area that are in big risk are the WebForms and applications that uses third-party DLLs..
Already seeing some compliance issues related to EOL frameworks for PCI efforts.
Security item: HTTP headers audit (information disclosure)
.Net upgrades are currently treated as a platform effort (no longer active work stream)
Testing at the public surface level 
Concerns about risk / bugs created by upgrading
Tech debt negotiations, active repos, ear mark with larger product project items 
Regression test gaps (critical paths)
Be able to point the suite to a given environment.  Integrate into the dev deployment or at least have it as a separate pipeline to run.
Shared  (??ownership / allocation??)
CRM, MyIIS, Email Queue Processing, Proxy Services, 
Dedicated product team not tied to a product roadmap but instead internal engineering roadmap for tech debt (Ctrl Alt Elite)

Miguel - concerns
Randy - concerns
Rene - ok

DECIDED
Documentation will be centralized under the Engineering Documentation space and links to the other space pages will be used for cross references.  Example linking a product to its deployment pipeline template documentation in the Platform Engineering space.   Example linking a product to its infrastructure documentation in the Platform Engineering space.
