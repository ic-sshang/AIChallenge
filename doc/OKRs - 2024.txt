.  Currently, all work performed by the Conversions team is managed through SalesForce.  This makes it difficult to operationalize conversions because we don't have access to the same project tools and artifacts that are available for implementations in SmartSheet.  After Conversions are migrated to SmartSheet there will be greater visibility, collaboration and management of the work performed in conversions resulting in more consistent project delivery.
