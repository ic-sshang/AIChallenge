RTDR and Data Pump Error Handling Meeting Notes
Date:
 09/10 
Attendees:
 Albert, Marcus, Mark, Fernando, Roopa
Current Situation
90% of errors occur in RTDR or data pump.
Engineering team often reaches out to client services to check customer endpoint status or changes.
Uncertainty about disabling RTDR and continuing with potentially stale balances for autopay.
No one-size-fits-all approach identified yet.
Goals
Involve the right team for effective and efficient problem-solving.
Increase response time.
Reduce toil for SPAM, Integration, and also for client services teams.
Problems and Challenges
Need to reduce noise, triggering alerts only for critical errors.
Unclear if conditions exist for high error rates or specific exceptions.
Not all applications send source ID to RTDR (Autopay does, others need review).
Proposed Solutions and Ideas
Improve Error Categorization:
 Set up conditions for high error rates or specific exceptions. Use biller ID and source (e.g., autopay) to calculate success vs. failure ratio.
Enhance RTDR Response:
 Add more properties to RTDR response objects (e.g., partial success information). Research benefits of providing context in responses (Integration and SPAM to collaborate).
Alert Routing and Management:
 Create an RTDR-specific Slack channel for alerts. Investigate adding Client Services to OpsGenie for relevant alerts. Implement tiered alerting system (warnings vs. errors) and alert only relevant teams.
Process Improvements:
Review and update applications to send source ID to RTDR.
Research efficiency improvements in invoice processing (Albert to review).
Today, many integrations loop through invoices for updates. We may report an error even if recent invoices processed successfully and only the old ones failed. {Albert to review for potential efficiency gains}
Documentation and Guidelines:
 Develop runbooks/rubric to help set SLAs and define courses of action.
Action Items
SRE team to confirm OpsGenie access for Client Services team.
SRE team to review current alert conditions in New Relic.
Analyze New Relic logs for actionable exceptions/errors.
SRE team and SPAM to discuss New Relic logs and creating an escalation tier.
Also, create an escalation tier with warnings for slow performance and errors for actual failures.
Alert only relevant teams based on the escalation tiers
Integration team to review invoice processing efficiency.
Integration team to research with SPAM team on enhancing RTDR response objects.
