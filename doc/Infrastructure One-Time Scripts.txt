Any scripts for maintenance, patching, data gathering, etc. should land in the 
Infrastructure_Onetime_Scripts
 repository in Systems_Src.
Ideally, you should include details on how to run your script + what it actually does as a comment at the top of the file you’re working on. 
There isn’t a ton of organization, but as you can see, we try to group scripts into their functional component, i.e. scripts that update the SKU of a Redis instance would fall into the redis directory, scripts that inventory virtual networks would fall into the vnet directory, etc.
When contributing, please commit your code to a feature branch, i.e. 
plat-1234-upgrade-redis-sku
, and push it. Once you’ve done some testing, 
open a pull request
 and ask the team to review your script. You should get your PR approved and merged to the main branch 
before 
you run it for maintenance. Once your PR is merged, you should be set to move your story to the 
Deployment Queue 
status.
