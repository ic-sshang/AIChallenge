Overview


Overview


The Outbound Payments post live phase consists of monitoring the Biller’s service to confirm that outbound payments are being made successfully, and functionality is as expected. This can include any follow up needed from functionality that is not as expected, ensuring a quality deliverable. The transition to Client Services support happens during this phase and the project is fully moved to completed.
