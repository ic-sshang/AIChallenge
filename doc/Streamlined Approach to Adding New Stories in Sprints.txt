We can and should create research spike for bugs and notify product team so we can bring them in.
We should be able to move a story to the "New Bug" status so we can send it to bug court and utilize DevSupport resources for analysis before it is re-assigned to the team for action.
We should set aside time to groom items in backlog
Focus need not just be on bugs. It could items we identify for refactoring in CodeScene. Create a spike and let the product team know.
In general, make it a point to communicate.
