Payment methods are partially masked in results.
Are user inputs and outputs stored securely and encrypted?
User inputs and the ChatAPI response (GraphQL query) are logged in New Relic.
Have role-based access controls been configured correctly?
 Yes
Users with all reporting permissions are granted access to the AI Report Generator at launch.
Admins can grant access to other users as needed.
Model Transparency
Is the model version and prompt logic documented?
 Yes
Model used is gpt-4o-mini.
Prompt is stored in code.
Is a model card available for reference?

Have potentially biased queries been tested?
 Not applicable
No direct response from the LLM is shown to the user.
Is there filtering for problematic queries (e.g., discriminatory intent)?
 Not applicable
No direct response from the LLM is shown to the user.
Human-in-the-Loop
Do users get to review/edit SQL before execution?
 No
Are high-risk queries flagged for manual review?
 Not applicable
No direct response from the LLM is shown to the user.
Audit & Logging
Are logs captured for prompts, SQL, user edits, execution, and results?
 Yes

Notes / Evidence
SQL Accuracy
Does the model produce correct SQL for benchmark queries?
 Yes
Include sample outputs
Input Variability
Are different phrasings of the same intent handled correctly?
 Yes
Include test cases
Result Correctness
Do returned results match expectations based on sample datasets?
 Yes
QA uses a set of various prompts and the expected GraphQL queries to verify correctness with each code change.
Ambiguity Handling
Is the system clear when the prompt is underspecified or ambiguous?
 Yes
“
I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand what you meant.
To help me generate the right report, can you try modifying your request and using different words?
For example: Generate a report of unpaid invoices with a due date within the next 7 days.
”
