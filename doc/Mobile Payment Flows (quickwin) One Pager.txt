Problem Alignment
The Problem
Customers are not able to enroll in Autopay, Paperless, or Pay by Text when making a mobile payment. Given that roughly 50% of our payments are made via mobile, we are losing out on additional adoption of these services that yield revenue.
Why: How do we know this is a real problem and worth solving?
The Autopay, Paperless, and Pay by Text enrollment checkboxes are not displayed in the mobile payment route. Showing these options in the mobile view will result in higher adoption and more sustained revenue over time.
Audience: Who are we building for?
We are building this for Invoice Cloud, our billers, and the end users.
High-level Approach
By adding the enrollment options for Autopay, Paperless, and Pay by Text to the mobile payment route in a simple way, we will increase adoption of these services.
Success
How do we know if we’ve solved this problem?
We will know we have succeeded if we see increased adoption of Autopay, Paperless, and Pay by Text among billers offering these services. We should also see an increase in the number of payments processed via Pay by Text.
Metrics to track:
