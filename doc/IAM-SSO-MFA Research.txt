This page represents a general dump of research, findings, etc, as we come up to speed on the concepts within the IAM/SSO/MFA areas.
 SSO Basics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1cRJWYF-g4
 Big Rocks
SSO
 (who owns the credentials that will be used to authenticate?)
This can be commercial idP or IC
MFA
 (who owns the authentication process?)
Do we do SMS? This costs money.
Email OTP is free, but terrible.
FIDO/Passkeys/TOTP are free and strong.
Roles
 (how do we map roles and permissions?)
 Does the mapping or our roles/permissions happen on a per-integration basis, or based on middleware, or idP?
 Core Entities
Authentication App
 (in our case: Biller Portal)
Commercial Identity Providers (idPs)
Examples: Okta, Auth0, OneLogin, Ping Id, Azure Entra ID
 Which are the providers we need support for?  (reference biller interviews)
 Do we need to do a biller survey?
Middleware App
Future-proofs against new protocols, vulnerability patches, etc
Reduces our coding effort to a single integration rather than many protocols
Key functions:
Centralize our product application Sign-Ins and MFA (for our users who log into our products directly, we manage the identity)
SSO with other idPs (for users who log into external systems and are then redirected into our product, they manage the identity)
 Do we want SaaS solution or on-prem?  Need Branden input.
Can be hosted login page or API comm
If hosted page, they own the MFA/etc
 Is there any reason we wouldn’t go hosted?
Examples: KeyCloak, Okta, Auth0, Azure AD, Zluri
Need to put together a matrix for comparison
Pricing
Protocols/idPs supported
Integration options
Branding/customization options
 What other factors are relevant?
 Who owns this research?
 
 Protocols
The type of communication the auth runs on
Examples: OAuth2, SAML, OpenID Connect, FIDO
Considerations:
Middleware selection should 
Do we need to support them all?
Do we standardize on one as long as all the major idPs support it?
Are some easier than others to implement?

SSO Workflow
Palash’s Notes:
MFA: 
As per the call with Boston, we would like to have as many options as possible, like the text message, passkeys, etc.
We should have a standardisation.
We will have variable costs if we have the sms enabled as on of the factors.
We will also need the commercials to support and provide background on why and why not we have certain factors involved.
Platform team needs to lead this eventually. Tom and Rob.
Post Delivery : We might need to get the SSO writer signed by the clients.
Notes from the discussion on 6th March:
Do we agree on the approach of using middleware?
Yes
Are there clear options we want to pursue?
Remove azure from list
Combine Auth0/Okta
List from Gartner report (get from Branden)

Auth0 - already a relationship due to Okta usage, way more developer friendly, easier integration for us
PingID – Branden has relationship
Has some additional features
Risk-based engine
Da Vinci – workflows
Keycloak – we host it ourselves (vs SaaS)
How do we decide on hosted vs on prem? What attributes need to be considered?
Also consider latency, worse in the cloud provider
Pricing is usually by identity, not by session
Another feature to consider: “someone logged into your account”, like Netflix
Can we solve the super biller problem here?
Can we hook into the same idP integration? Allows one account to access multiple billers?
Need to reach out to our contacts, start with Rob and Branden
What level of involvement/role does everyone want?
Make sure Shanki is involved (and other India lead in different lane?)
Rob, not a ton of involvement
Branden, guide
Bring Ray in when we’ve decided what solution, and we’ll figure out next steps
Inputs from Co Pilot:
Hosted Login Page:
Yes, all three platforms—Auth0, Keycloak, and PingID—provide hosted login pages for web portals.
Auth0
: Auth0 offers Universal Login, a hosted login page that handles the authentication process for your application
[1]
[2]
. It provides easy customization options to create a consistent, branded experience for users
[3]
.
Keycloak
: Keycloak uses a default hosted login page for user authentication
[4]
. You can customize this login page to match your application's branding and design
[5]
[6]
.
PingID
: PingID provides secure authentication methods, including hosted login pages for web portals
[7]
. It supports various authentication methods such as biometrics, OTPs, and security keys
[7]
.
These hosted login pages simplify the authentication process and enhance security for your web portals.
Is there a specific feature or customization you're interested in for these login pages?

Threat detection
:
Yes, threat detection is available with Auth0, Keycloak, and PingID.
Auth0
: Auth0 provides robust threat detection features, including bot detection, suspicious IP throttling, brute force protection, and breached password detection
[1]
[2]
. These features help identify and mitigate malicious attempts to access your application.
Keycloak
: Keycloak offers brute force detection capabilities, which can identify and respond to multiple failed login attempts indicative of brute force attacks
[4]
[3]
. Administrators can configure thresholds and actions to protect against unauthorized access.
PingID
: PingID includes threat protection through PingOne Protect, which uses machine learning and configurable security policies to analyze user identity and detect potential threats
[5]
[6]
. It evaluates various risk factors, such as IP reputation, device trust, and user behavior anomalies, to prevent identity fraud and account takeover
[7]
.
These platforms provide comprehensive threat detection mechanisms to enhance the security of your web portals.
Is there a specific threat detection feature you're interested in learning more about?
