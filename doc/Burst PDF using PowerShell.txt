Purpose
: This document is meant as a 
step-by-step guide
 to run the PowerShell script you provided. This script splits a PDF file into separate pages using a library called 
iTextSharp
.
Script File (latest version available in the 
scripts repo
):
What You’ll Need
A 
Windows PC
PowerShell
 (comes pre-installed on Windows)
An internet connection (for the first-time setup)
A PDF file you want to split
Step-by-Step Instructions
Step 1: Install iTextSharp (One-Time Setup)
Open 
PowerShell as Administrator
:
Click the 
Start Menu
, type 
PowerShell
, right-click it, and choose 
Run as administrator
.
Run this command to install the iTextSharp library:
Install-Package iTextSharp -Source https://www.nuget.org/api/v2 -Scope CurrentUser
If prompted to trust the source, type 
Y
 and press 
Enter
.
📝 This step only needs to be done once.
Step 2: Prepare Your PDF File
Place your PDF file in a folder you can easily access, like 
C:\Users\YourName\Documents\PDFs
.
Note the 
full path
 to the file. For example:
   C:\Users\YourName\Documents\PDFs\example.pdf

🧾 Step 3: Update the Script
Open the script using 
Notepad or Notepad++
, and make these changes:
Replace the path in this line with the actual path to your PDF:
  $inputFile = "C:\Users\YourName\Documents\PDFs\example.pdf"

Make sure the path to the iTextSharp DLL matches where it was installed. It’s usually something like:
  Add-Type -Path "C:\Users\YourName\.nuget\packages\itextsharp\5.5.8\lib\itextsharp.dll"

Save the file with a 
.ps1
 extension, for example:
split-pdf.ps1
Step 4: Run the Script
Open 
PowerShell
 (you don’t need admin this time).
Navigate to the folder where your script is saved. For example:
   cd "C:\Users\YourName\Documents\PDFs"

Run the script:
   .\split-pdf.ps1

Step 5: Check the Output
The script will create new PDF files in the same folder, each containing one page from the original PDF.
Files will be named like 
example.1.pdf
, 
example.2.pdf
, etc.
Troubleshooting Tips
