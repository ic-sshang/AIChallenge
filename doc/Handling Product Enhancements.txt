Notes from Shelby:
Guru card on the process for submitting a product enhancement: 
https://app.getguru.com/card/TpMBE5ac/How-to-Submit-Change-Requests-to-Product
 Anyone can submit a product enhancement. The Product team has a weekly product request intake meeting that happens every Tuesday at 3:00 pm CST. There we discuss new requests with the submitter. The next day product meets to assign the request to a particular team. 
I know Cat and client services have a meeting prior to the intake just to make sure the requests coming in are valid/or find if there is another existing solution. It may be a good idea to reach out to her to know about her process.
Intake meeting zoom link: 
Every Tuesday at 3pm CST
