Prepare this section for the review meeting
 Problem Alignment
Internally and externally we don’t have consistent known standards for how our product should and does work. We lack standard service level agreements to share with customers and know and uphold internally. 
 Objective
The objective of this project will be ongoing however it is to first establish what SLAs we want to have and then provide monitoring internally to the system performance. 
SLA (Service Level Agreement)
​
Definition
: Formal agreement on service standards​
Example
: Compensation for not meeting SLOs​
Purpose
: Ensures accountability and outlines consequences for not meeting SLOs
 Success Metrics
List the project goals and metrics that will be used to determine its success.

Impact
Dev Support Team
Dev support team can benefit from established SLAs by better understanding our system standards to identify problems sooner.
Customer Service Team 
 CS team can benefit from SLAs by being able to share these with customers and payers, and identify when there are issues sooner.
 
User Interaction and Design
Eventually we would like to have a view of our key products performance accessible to all internal teams. However monitoring will most likely start within New Relic and alerts to slack.

Have Data? or Need dev work to get data?
As a payer I want to receive my one time payment SMS text sent from the biller portal within 5 minutes of it being sent. 
SMS
Latency
 ​
Availability/Saturation
time from biller sending SMS from the biller portal to the time the payer receives this
Weekly volume of SMS sent - tracking this over time?.
Have data - next steps to expose. We do have an SMS data table. 
sms.smsOut table
NR event Table has volume data
As a payer I want to receive my Change Password email notification to be sent within 5 min of requesting.
Email notifications
Latency
 ​
Availability/Saturation
average time it takes for payer to receive a password reset email once they have requested from Virtual Site or Customer Portal 
NR table emailqueuelog should have this data. Need Validation
As a payer I want to receive payment receipt notification for one time payment route within 5 min of payment
Email notifications
Latency
 ​
Availability/Saturation
average time it takes for payer to receive a payment receipt email after one time payment (VS, or CP). Needed for consolidated email receipt and sign receipt.
NR table emailqueuelog should have this data. Need Validation
As a biller I want autopay, and scheduled payments to process every morning before 8:30 am my time. 
Autopay Processing 
Volume/Traffic
 ​
Errors
average time it takes autopay to run for a biller
things we have now - when nothing has run for a biller in 20 minutes after starting. We know when something hasn’t processed in 20 min. 
we are adding alerts on when the autopay job doesn’t start at all for a biller 
number of billers per day that don’t have their autopay complete by 8:30 their local time. 
Number of errors growing 
weekly autopay traffic? processing more traffic on certain days monthly?
Have data in New Relic. Need to implement structured logging to get the biller-level data as well. Onboarding to Batch Monitoring. 
As a biller I want AutoPay reminders to go out X days prior to processing. 
Email notifications 
Availability/Saturation
 ​
Latency
 ​
Average days to send AutoPay reminder emails out before processing is typically 3 days for most billers, but can be edited. How many of those emails are not sent on in the correct time frame set? It is invoice option 63 for setting the days prior to processing to send.
Have to see how we can get this info from emailqueuelog table in NR
As IC support I want to know if a biller is having RTDR issues and it is taking a while to run. 
RTDR
Volume/Traffic
 ​
Errors
Average daily errors of RDTR and can slice this by biller
RTDR run time by biller
RTDR erroring, slowing down AutoPay processing.
Have to see how we can improve RTDRTransactions event table. 
As a biller using High Volume AutoPay I want my AutoPay processed by 8 am my local time.
HighVolumeAutoPay
Volume/Traffic
 ​
Errors
average time it takes autopay to run for a biller with HighVolumeAutoPay.
alert when HighVolumeAutoPay billers do not have process finish before 8 am. 
Need to bring under APM
As IC support I want to know if there are any errors in RSP generation. 
RSP Generator
Errors
errors in RSP and scheduled payment generation. We’ve seen errors in this before/ not selecting the correct invoice for scheduled payment. 
Need to bring under APM and improve structured logging. 
Measurements
 
Volume/Traffic
 ​
Definition
: Amount of demand on your service. ​
Indicator
: Shows popularity or seasonal usage spikes. ​
Availability/Saturation
 ​
Definition
: How "full" your service is (usage of resources). ​
Warning
: Approaching or reaching capacity can degrade performance. ​
Latency
 ​
Definition
: Time it takes to process a request. ​
Impact
: Directly affects user satisfaction; faster is better. ​
Errors
 ​
Definition
: Rate of failed requests. ​
Concern
: High error rates deter users and indicate issues. ​
Tickets
​
Definition
: No of Alerts and incidents​
Concern
: Alerts and incidents indicate the current problems in the service​
