Text color discussed and agreed upon by team:
neutral-80 for ALL TEXT (headings, body and helper text)
neutral-70 for disabled text over neutral-10
Button variants added:
Secondary button with and without icon
leading and lagging icons
Team agreed that there will be NO more primary or secondary size variants (i.e. no buttons that have a shorter height to fit more snuggly into a table row)
Prototype setup in design system:
Team members can hook up the design system components with the prototyping states, so that prototyping is easier to grab and go
