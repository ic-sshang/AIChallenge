Transferring ownership and selecting linked accounts
 
SHOULD HAVE
Yellow
 
If I am transferring an account linked to multiple accounts, I want to select all linked accounts to transfer over to the new Account Owner or select which accounts to transfer over to the new Account Owner.
For transferring accounts with linked accounts:
Should allow user to select the linked accounts to transfer – select all option / select individual
If a separate Account Owner on the linked accounts exists, do not make any updates to the transferred user
The user login type stays the same in this process
Where are we building this?
Biller Portal
Customer Portal
Why are we building this?
This new feature will 
prevent users from overriding email addresses
 in the Customer Portal which leads to unintended consequences including granting payment methods to the wrong user login.
