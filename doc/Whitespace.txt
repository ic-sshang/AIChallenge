Use Spaces Around Operators
:
Add spaces around operators to make expressions easier to read.
c#
int sum = a + b;
if (x == y)
{
    // Do something
}
Separate Logical Sections with Blank Lines
:
Use blank lines to separate different sections of your code, such as between methods, before comments, and within methods to separate logical blocks.
Avoid Excessive Whitespace
:
While whitespace improves readability, avoid adding too many blank lines or spaces, which can make the code look cluttered.
c#
// Bad
public void ProcessData(List<int> data)
{


    foreach (var item in data)
    {


        if (item > 0)
        {


            Console.WriteLine(item);
        }
    }
}
