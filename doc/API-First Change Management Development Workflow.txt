Make changes to the API code repository
Test it locally on your dev workstation with Postman. 
If you are changing the API contract ( endpoints, request, or response specifications ) use these approaches:
Backwards Compatibility:
 Ensure that new changes are backward compatible. Avoid removing or renaming existing endpoints, parameters, or response fields. Instead, deprecate them gradually and provide clear documentation on their future removal.
Versioning
: If the changes are not backward compatible implement API versioning. This allows you to introduce changes in a new version of the API while keeping the old version available for clients who haven’t updated yet. Use URI versioning (e.g., 
/v1/resource
).  
Versioning
 
Make sure you add/modify automated contract tests to cover your contract changes.  
Build and deploy your branch to the development environment.
Run the automated contract tests against your API dev deployment.  Example, Payer Branding API contract tests: 
https://dev.azure.com/invoicecloud/Src/_build?definitionId=2071
There should be NO test failures.   If you have test failure(s) inspect the test log to understand what test(s) failed, remediate, and go back to #1.
100% passing tests means your branch is ready for a Pull Request.
