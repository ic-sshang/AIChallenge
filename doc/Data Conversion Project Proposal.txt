Need Help?
If for whatever reason, the tool does not meet the needs of the conversion you may escalate to the Integrations team for assistance by submitting an ITG request. If the request is urgent, the 
#new-revenue-priorities
 slack channel can be used for escalations.
For all other issues requiring troubleshooting or reporting a bug should follow the normal practices of submitting a ticket with our Dev Support team.
