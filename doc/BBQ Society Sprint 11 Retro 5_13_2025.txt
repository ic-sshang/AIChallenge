Random Thoughts/Music Request
Size items for actual effort, no more sizing based on work type (Marcus ok’d) +wow🔥
Pre-groom triage items during triage (add tests, where to make change, side effects…). Grooming needs to get faster.
Dedicate time during your day to study the flowcharts and other relevant Confluence documents. +1
(This may already be the 
“BBQ Int Team”
 folder) Create a hub of all documentation, links, tools, items, etc that relates to BBQ in Confluence.
Start putting up all the research and diagrams done together for the PDF containerization to ensure clarity on the implementation plan, so we can start working on actually coding.
Improving the automated testing process by providing detailed Pipe Delimited File to testers.
Create a “template” of generic X-Rays that need to be added to certain BBQ Components. This will help alleviate the “figuring out” , “guess work”, “confusion” of what needs to be added to certain items in our backlog. +1
Long winded grooming debates (perhaps ~1)
Avoid putting the Editable ICTemplates project a side, ensure remains with the same priority.
Note to oneself: Don’t forget your personal and team goals (chris needs to work on his) 
. +1
 Making pages for spikes in Confluence, remember to tie them in the page/item.
Keep it up the hard work.
Keep the redefinition of grooming and triage processes for better workflow.
Keep working on standardizing docker containerization for microservices projects.
