Smaller MFEs that can be reused in Bigger MFEs
The "
Edit Recurring Payment
" and "
Edit Autopay
" features use the same screen layout, allowing them to share a common or smaller Micro Frontend (MFE) that can be reused.
The sections for 
Open Invoices, Closed Invoices, Upcoming Scheduled Payments,
 and 
Payment History
 all utilize a shared MFE in the form of a grid layout.
Likewise, 
Open Invoices, Closed Invoices, Recent Payments,
 and 
Upcoming Scheduled Payments
 all use a common summary card component, which can also be reused on the homepage of the Payer Portal.

Paperless, Autopay, Payment methods, etc
 
We don’t have Grid component current in design system.
