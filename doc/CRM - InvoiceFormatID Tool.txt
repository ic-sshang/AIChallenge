Description:
 Tool to insert, view, and remove 
InvoiceFormatIDs
 for new bill presentment methods
Permissions:
 
CRMPermissions
 Enum: add a new value for the 
InvoiceFormatID
 tool in the Enum, this needs to match with what is going to be stored in 
tblCrmPermissions
 in the 
DB
 (a DBR will be needed).
We can then limit visibility/actions depending on whether the user has the required permissions.
Set Up:
A great example of what we are trying to achieve with this tool is the 
Virtual Site ReCaptcha Whitelisted IPs
 tool. Reference the following in the ICCRM repo for setting up the tool: 
SupportIPWhitelistTool.aspx
, 
SupportIPWhitelistTool.aspx.vb
, 
EditSupportIPWhitelistTool.aspx
, 
EditSupportIPWhitelistTool.aspx.vb
,
Create a repository to handle the database interactions
Proposed UI Design:
To ensure consistency across CRM tools, we will replicate the design used in the 
Virtual Site ReCaptcha Whitelisted IPs
 tool, as it already reflects the appropriate structure.
