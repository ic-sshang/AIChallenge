Problem Alignment
The Problem
Billers are unable to properly track, limit, and manage actions taken by CSRs in the Biller Portal.
 They need better visibility and control over the permissions to meet auditing and security requirements, both internally and externally. Today, billers must sometimes choose to grant or deny permissions 
too broadly
 to meet the appropriate access for certain individuals. One example would be a city that manages tax payments and police payments in our system. In some cases, they might only want a particular user or role to view and/or take action on certain Invoice Types.
Additionally, it is time consuming to manually set permissions for every single user, rather than simply assigning a role that has pre-defined permissions associated with it. This also makes it difficult to manage any changes that are made for particular users or roles in their organization.
Why: How do we know this is a real problem and worth solving?
Billers have requested more granular control over the permissions that exist for Biller Portal users. Additionally, they ask for custom reports that show the users and permissions in order to properly audit the access levels.
Audience: Who are we building for?
We are building this for our billers, but it will also benefit Invoice Cloud by reducing the number of IT requests for custom reports.
Some billers manage tax payments and police payments in our system. In some cases, they might only want a particular user (or role) to view and/or take action on certain Invoice Types.
High-level Approach
Create more granular permissions for biller portal users, as well as new functionality to create and manage “roles” that have a set of permissions tied to them. We should allow the biller to define a set of permissions for each role/position, which they can then designate to users.
We should also create a report that provides a list of users and permissions, broken down by roles. It’s likely that we will need to track changes to users/roles that the biller can view for auditing purposes.
Success
How do we know if we’ve solved this problem?
We will be successful if the number of requests for permission related features is reduced over time. 
Solution Alignment
Key Features
Create and manage “roles” that are associated with particular permissions
Each role can have a customized set of permissions associated with it
Each user can be assigned a Role, which grants the permissions for that role
Outside of role-based permissions, users should be able to have individual permissions
Allow billers to hide/show passwords based on permissions, rather than a system-wide setting (option 35 in CRM)
Separate the “reset password” from the “show password” functionality
The biller should be able to allow certain users to reset passwords, but not see them.
Create more granular permissions for financial-related actions
Split apart processing payments vs. processing refunds
Split apart real-time transactions vs. offline adjustments
Create permissions for actions such as Autopay enrollment, Paperless enrollment, and Pay by Text enrollment
Consider permissions for certain Invoice Types
Example: A user that only has the “Utility” invoice type permission would not be able to run reports for “Real Estate” or “Personal Property” invoice types.

Meeting Notes 4/17/2023 - Nicole, Ange, John, Byron, Ryan
Topic: New User Interface for Roles and Permissions Management
Key Points:
Provide default roles to users for ease of use and to avoid starting from scratch.
Allow users to choose from existing permissions to create custom roles.
Only one role per user is allowed.
Provide flexibility in modifying roles with the "override" feature. (allow “save as role…”?)
Offer an option for users to copy custom roles or permissions. (“save as” when editing permissions for a user or role)
Provide clear explanations for specific permissions. (tooltips perhaps?)
Involve sales and implementation teams for further discussion and validation.
Additional Discussions:
Adding users and configuring them in the user list.
Working with roles in the manage roles screen.
Implementing bulk changes for active and inactive roles.
Considering the impacts of overrides on the number and length of roles.
Implementing an audit log for users and roles.
Addressing deletion of roles and its effects on assigned users.
Navigating between the manage role and manage users pages.
Starting development roadmap on May 1st.
Organizing requirements, user stories, and Figma links on the Confluence page to avoid redundancy.
Next Steps:
Share and discuss these ideas with sales and implementation teams.
Ensure the overall understanding of user requirements for interface design.
Complete requirements and get feedback.
Work on detailing user stories, Figma links, and project requirements.
Roles Management:
Admins should be able to create new roles in the biller portal.
Admins should also be able to edit existing roles, including changing the permissions tied to them.
Admins can delete roles, but only if no one is using that role. If they try to delete an in-use role, they'll see an error message.
Every role must have a unique name in the system.
Assigning Permissions to Roles:
When creating or tweaking a role, admins can add one or more permissions, sorted by categories.
A full list of permissions, organized by categories, is available (check the confluence page).
There's no need for search or filter features in the Permissions section.
User Role Assignment:
a.	Admins can easily assign a role to a user in the biller portal.
b.	Users can have just one role at a time. If they get a new role, it replaces the old one.
Extra Permissions for Users:
a.	Admins can give users more permissions than what their role provides.
b.	Role-related permissions should be grayed out and unchangeable in the Permissions section.
c.	Admins can save the selected set of permissions as a new role and give it a name.
User Interface and Experience:
a.	The User Management submenu should have links to Manage Users, Manage Roles, and the Permission Audit Log page.
b.	The design for the Roles and Permissions feature should match the current biller portal look.
c.	Pop-up notices will let users know when they've successfully completed actions, like creating, saving, or deleting roles and permissions.
d.	Mobile support isn't necessary for this feature.
Access and Auditing:
a.	The system will ensure only authorized admins can manage roles and permissions.
b.	It'll also keep a log of changes made to roles and permissions (who, what, and when), with support for filtering and searching.
