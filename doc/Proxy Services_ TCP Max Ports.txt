We found that our proxy services were being bottlenecked by the 
MaxUserPort
 setting, which was capped at 4 or 5k (can’t currently remember). We updated this to the maximum value: 65534. 
We’re planning to transition the proxy services to run in containers in AKS during Q2 2025. Research showed that we cannot change this setting in Windows nodes within AKS; we’re stuck with the default value of 16384. This setting is configurable for Linux nodes. Overall, this shouldn’t be an issue - we can just scale horizontally as needede.
