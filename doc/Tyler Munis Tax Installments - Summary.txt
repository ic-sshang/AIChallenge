Many Tyler Munis billers issue multiple installments for a tax bill for Real Estate and other tax types.
Installments for Tyler Munis have to be handled in a particular way given a limitation with the data received. Not all installments can be represented and open at once, instead only the current installment with the amount due now and the total amount can be displayed
Limitation
: 
The daily balance file from Tyler Munis (Details Receivable Report) only includes current amount owed for entire bill and does not break out balances by installment. 
Implementation
:
The user has the option to either pay the total bill amount or the amount owed (balances currently due). Invoice Cloud cannot represent all installments simultaneously as when adjustments come through it is not possible to determine how it should be split among the outstanding installments.
When the next installment becomes due a bill file will be loaded by the biller to IC to create next installment, this will zero out the existing installment and the current amount owed (which now includes the new installment), the the total bill amount, and the new due date will be set on the installment.
