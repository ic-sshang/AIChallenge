Summary
This permission allows you to cancel a transaction before it has settled. To determine if a transaction is eligible for cancellation, check the 
settledBatchId
 value:
settledBatchId = 0
: The batch has not settled, and no charge has been made to the customer, so the transaction can be canceled under this permission.
settledBatchId > 0
: The batch has already settled, requiring a refund instead of a cancellation. Refunds are governed by a separate permission (Permission 37).
