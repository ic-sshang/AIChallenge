Objective
The objective of this page is to explain our current payment plan definitions and options for expanding upon these. The three use cases described below are Delinquent Utility, Delinquent Tax and Prelim Tax. Delinquent Tax and Prelim Tax have the most overlap since they would use the FlexPay product and are already being sold. There is opportunity to collect additional billers and payments in these use cases. Delinquent Utility we believe IC is already processing these payments and therefore do not have opportunity to grow additional payments in this space.
