Decisions
2 CPU Core Limit as the lowest Limit for CPU to allow for parallel processing.
We will enhance our helm charts to ensure that client provides values for CPU and memory requests and limits
We will move toward making all container filesystems read-only and requiring a special exemption for any local writes (this applies to the container filesystem, not volume mounts)
