Harris is rolling out AUS V5.  
THIS HAS NO IMPACT ON INVOICE CLOUD INTEGRATION.  
All integration steps that are defined for previous versions are compatible with new AUS V5.
Data Structure

Transmission Method
Details
Invoice
TXT File
FTPS (Default) or SFTP (if required)
Invoice Cloud maps TXT file to BIF Format
Standard Naming Convention:
 BID_TIMESTAMP_BillType.TXT (Example: "123_20180201_UB.TXT")
The AUS team refers to this file as the "Initial Data Dump" before going Live, because they will query in the past to retrieve information of all the accounts etc. After the biller goes live they refer to it as "IC Daily Export" file.
Adjustments/Balances
RTDR API Method: GetAccountData
RTDR
We receive blocks for ACH and CC in the billing/invoice file and also update via RTDR:
AUS will provide this in field 356 of the invoice billing/invoice file if a customer is blocked from making CC payments.
AUS will provide this in field 357 of the invoice billing/invoice file if a customer is blocked from making ACH payments.
For Adjustments/Balances transmitted via RTDR, the AUS "cash only" flag will update the "block ACH" and "block CC" options in IC. There is no separate AUS flag to block only one - this AUS "cash only" flag will block both payment types.

Bill Images 
PDF Linking - Supported
PDF Extraction - Supported 
Template - Not Supported
The Standard AUS integration uses Advanced Utility PdfViewer
 (1918BF19-973B-4930-800E-2005C652C62A),
 web service: RetrieveBillPrintImageV2
The integration supports PDF Linking and PDF Extraction. If the biller wants to provide bill images outside of the standard integration process, the setup would need to be handled directly with the biller. Template is not supported.
Advanced SSO Standard:
 Remote Linking
Advanced Non SSO Standard:
 Either Remote linking or PDF Extraction. This depends on the print vendor
Logis Standard:
 PDF Extraction
PDF Linking is supported for REST or SOAP. Implementations will need to confirm which API calls are available for the biller.

Check Free - FISERV - Cash
Supported*
*
Only supported if biller uses our Online Bank Direct Product. 
This product would be used if municipalities allowed coordinating bill pay with customers banks. A payer will setup a recurring payment or autopay using their bank account and the bank sends over the paper check via FiServ to be applied to the customers account in IC.
CloudPay
Not Supported*
*Not supported Standard Advanced Integrations. See below for Logis Integrations
:
Logis coded to CloudPay v1 for eProperty payments
. eProperty payments are in person payments that take place in the biller’s office or over the phone payments that are processed by the biller’s Customer Service Representative (CSR). 
These types of payments are not sent through the Data Pump. Therefore, 
a Payment Export File needs to be coded by IC IT, sent to the biller daily frequency with any CloudPay payments that are made. 
The Payment Export File can be sent via email or FTP (preferred) for imported into Logis. (Sample file was provided to Logis and integration appears to be completed per ITRs 11596, 11840, and 12836).
CloudPay Web Services

Supported
This is used for ad hoc non-invoice payments. Biller would have to manually update payment in their CIS and IC doesn’t send CloudStore payments through the data pump.

Account Linking
Supported
Advanced Settings 75 and 76 are used for AUS account linking. Advanced Setting 75 will link together any customer account that has the same customer number. Advanced Setting 76 will link together any customer account that has a common e-mail address. Having both settings enabled, will link together any account(s) with the same e-mail address and password and customer number.
This would apply for both Non-SSO and SSO. The SSO vendor (If using a 3rd party) would need to include the API call to link the accounts.
       Multi-User Log In

Multi user functionality is handled by the SSO vendor or Invoice Cloud, depending on how customers access their online account.

Advanced setting 32 is also configured to ensure the block payments flags are not in set in IC by a biller portal user, and only updated via RTDR.
Conveyance
Not Supported
Normally when a payer moves, the biller updates their own CIS with the new tenant’s name, as account numbers stays with the customer and the location number stays with the property.  AUS will send these details over to IC in the next billing cycle and IC will update the account with the new tenants name.
