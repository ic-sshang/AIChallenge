Liveness Probe
:
A liveness probe determines if a container is still running and functioning correctly. If the liveness probe fails, Kubernetes considers the container to be unhealthy and takes appropriate action, such as restarting the container. Liveness probes are essential for applications that can encounter runtime issues or deadlock situations.
Readiness Probe
:
A readiness probe determines if a container is ready to receive incoming network traffic and serve requests. It ensures that the container has completed its initialization process and is prepared to handle requests. If the readiness probe fails, Kubernetes removes the container's IP address from the service's list of endpoints, directing traffic to other healthy containers.
Startup Probe
:
A startup probe is used to determine if a container's application has started successfully. It is mainly useful for scenarios where an application takes a longer time to start but can eventually become healthy. Unlike liveness and readiness probes, the result of a startup probe does not affect the container's readiness or liveness status. Once the startup probe succeeds, the liveness and readiness probes take over.

Kubernetes Probes
Services (long-running jobs) should expose health checks exposed on HTTP endpoints (even for console apps).
Cron jobs do not need to expose health checks. Part of job’s startup routine should be interacting with dependent infrastructure; if it can’t, it should just fail.
Every service should have two endpoints: one endpoint for liveness and another for readiness.
Liveness endpoint should be available at 
/health/live
Simply returns 200; no logic
Readiness endpoint should be available at 
/health/ready
Should check to ensure any external dependencies are available (i.e. SQL Server, key vault)
Should use 
HealthChecks library
 to configure these where possible
Should check both Azure (or other external) dependencies and internal (to IC) dependencies (i.e. ICDatabaseService)
Every K8s pod should have probes configured for both liveness and readiness
Any k8s pod may have a startup probe configured to hit the liveness endpoint
This would let us hit only the liveness endpoint while the app is starting. Following successful responses from the startup probe, both the liveness and readiness endpoints will begin probing. It does not need to be present in your app unless necessary
