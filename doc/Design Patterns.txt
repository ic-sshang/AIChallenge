Overview
This section will cover common design patterns, when to use them, and when not to use them.
Software Design Patterns are just a re-usable solution to a common problem - they are “templates” or “blueprints” for tackling scenarios that repeat themselves over and over in software projects. There are several sub-categories of design patterns that represent the problem space in which they are focused: 
Behavioral, Creational, 
and
 Structural. 
While design patterns exist in every programming paradigm (even in system & software architecture), focus generally comes from an Object-Oriented perspective and they can be seen more as a 
Prerequisites
Optional
 - Familiarize yourself with 
Cyclomatic Complexity
An over-simplification of this concept is basically 
how many possible results can occur given the number of logical branches in a method.
Caveats
There is a tendency, when learning about design patterns, to begin seeking out places to use them and often people begin finding themselves in the “All I have is a hammer and every problem is a nail” scenario.
It is often best to first approach things with the 
KISS Principle
 in mind and start small. If requirements begin to indicate a need for ongoing work or flexibility in a part of the system (read “lots of future changes”) or if existing code is becoming difficult to maintain because there is TOO much going on - it is a good idea to evaluate whether a pattern implementation could simplify things or make things easier to test and maintain. 
In general, design patterns are meant to make the codebase 
easier
 to work with, not harder - they are well-suited for situations when you need to more effectively manage complexity and/or break down larger processes into isolated, testable chunks. If you find yourself struggling to navigate the codebase under a mass of disjoint files, then it’s highly likely that patterns are being over-applied.
