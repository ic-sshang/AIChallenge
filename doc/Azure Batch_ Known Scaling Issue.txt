There’s an error 
Resize errors: Desired number of dedicated nodes could not be allocated as the resize timeout was reached (Code: AllocationTimedout)
This error has been acknowledged and researched with Microsoft support.
This error has been seen on pool 
vnet-autopaychainpool
and 
icbatch 
pools (
HighVolumeNotifications
 & 
StandardNotifications
 ).
Based on research from the Microsoft team, this ‘error’ has been identified due to the auto scale formula that has been configured. The current configuration is 
"$NodeDeallocationOption = taskcompletion"
. As a result, the node cannot be deallocated until the task is fully completed, leading to a resize error. 
Furthermore, this error does not impact task completion; it only affects the pool resize according to the auto scale formula. This is not so much of an error, more so of a warning.
