Logs
Noisy Logs
Discuss with New Relic how to remove noise and junk logs.
Are drop filters enough to reduce costs?
Do we need to stop ingestion altogether?
Need to tackle duplicated logs. This could cut our ingestion cost by 50%.
Log Data Partition
Data Partitions would allow our teams to organize logs into logical groups/categories, making it easier to find log data related to specific applications. Furthermore, queries would be executed faster and cost less in terms of execution, potentially reducing costs.

Parsing Rules
A quick way to visually extract attributes from your logs after they've been ingested into New Relic. Can be handy to transform attributes such as “Message.properties.#” into the actual field name (Biller ID, Application Server, etc).
Action Item:
 create parsing rules based on existing logs to make them more user-friendly and helpful when debugging production issues.

Lookup Tables
For instances where the data needed to debug is not available in New Relic but is available in our database, we should start using lookup tables to improve debugging time.

 ->This can also come in handy for recurrent requests from our billers, such as Safety Insurance, where they need to see all SSO errors for their customers. New Relic doesn’t have the relationship data between Billers and Customers, so this is currently a 2-step process of extracting data from the DB and running Vlookups in Excel to produce a weekly report.
Metric Ingestion
Azure Metric Ingestion
Currently, we’re ingesting all Azure metrics twice. “Azure Monitor Metrics” is the new Azure ingestion mechanism that provides all the metrics data to New Relic. The legacy integrations can be discontinued, keeping them on increases our costs without any upsides. The only problem with the “Azure Monitor Metrics” integration is that they don’t come with predefined dashboards. Those will have to be added manually, but they are generally available.
Logical Grouping
Workloads
Workloads give us the ability to organize our data in ways that make the most sense for the business. Ideally, we should follow the same approach applied to Data Partitions to Workloads to make them aligned with business applications.
