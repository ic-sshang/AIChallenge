Functional Understanding:
FinMod is a console application that runs monthly to audit and generate monthly report for all the fees calculations and summary.
The program is executed monthly for example it executes on 1 December to prepare a summary or report for the prior month that is 1st November to 30th November.
The program basically gets list of all active billers, and it iterates over each biller to process for each, it calculates all the fees and saves the results into database.
After that the program executes a Stored Procedure to summarize all the charges or fees to generate statements for each biller.
The story EBPP-6017 is to include the Charge back fees along with the existing calculation process.
The fees rate and specification is already there, we just need to use it inside the calculation.
Technical Understanding
Architecture wise the FinMod component is placed inside the InvoiceCloud box.
The FinMod project’s code is in the FMHistoricalBilling repository.
In the diagram shown below of the FinMod component there are two sub-components I and J.
I block is responsible for doing all the calculation of fees and auditing.
J block is responsible for the summarization and statement generation.
Various date related work is done using the below 
Stored Procedures:
(DB: Shard2002)
selActiveBillers_FM
spCheckBillerPricingChange
PurgePaymentRevenue
selBillerFeeCalculations
selPaymentsForRequeue
spCreateBillSummary
As per our current understating and conversation we need to add new condition for charge back fee. ProcessSingleBiller in process all biller.
Solution need to verify with in generateMonthelySummary statement for chargback fee.
