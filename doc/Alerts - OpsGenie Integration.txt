Skybot is an application that supports scheduling processes to run at specific intervals such as Daily, Weekly, and Monthly. (Also supports running multiple times throughout the day)
The process that runs on skybot does need to be configured to handle exceptions and set Exit Code. 
Assuming the process is a state to alert correctly - Follow these steps here to configure an OpsGenie Integration
Locate Process on Skybot
Ex: Locating ICGatewayAutoClose - Right Click → Edit Job → Status Notification
Ensure that the Failed Status Notification is configured to send an email to ‘Alerts’
The email tied to “Alerts” is configured here in Skybot/Automate: skybot@invoicecloud.opsgenie.net
After Skybot is configured correctly the OpsGenie Integration does need to be configured here: 
https://invoicecloud.app.opsgenie.com/settings/integrations/
Create/Edit Alert as needed: Editing an existing alert here with Rule Name and then alert filters to match the job name on skybot along with word FAILED
