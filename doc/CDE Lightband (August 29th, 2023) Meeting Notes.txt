MAIN PAIN POINTS

 Discussion topics
Item
Notes
Adoption Rate
They are currently at 77% adoption with auto pay being a large portion.
Considering adding PayPal and CheckFreePay (especially due to $3 million in cash payments in July).
File Dashboard
They are interested in early access to the file dashboard.
Roles and Permissions
They are interested in using custom roles to better manage varying user permissions.
AutoPay delays
Identified pain points around late auto pay drafts and landlord account reconnects.
Auto pay drafts sometimes occurred later in the morning after CDW had already started collections calls and cut-offs, causing issues if payments came through after an account was disconnected. Invoice Cloud to look into adjusting timing of auto pay runs.
When landlord accounts automatically reconnected on tenant move-out, auto pay was not also reconnecting. Landlords had to manually set up auto pay again. 
Invoice Cloud is close to having a solution to automatically reconnect auto pay with account reconnect.
DataPump errors
Occasional data pump errors overnight. It can happen when the batch is settling. She has to resend the failed ones. Not a huge issue but something to look into.
Suggestions / Complaints
Scheduled payments on inactive accounts should be cancelled. They are deactivating them in Milsoft.
Business customers want to use autopay with a CC but there's a $750 cap.
Chris suggested a new invoice type with a separate cap for commercial accounts.
Transaction Reversals 
(need more info)
They can't perform step 1 of reversing transaction.
Can we let them reverse from Milsoft, instead of having to batch and then reverse it?
