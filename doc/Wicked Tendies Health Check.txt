How to Run
Wicked Tendies' (WT) Health Check job runs automatically 3 times per work day at 9 AM, 12 PM, and 4:30 PM. These times are after critical jobs have finished processing.
Who is responsible of monitoring the job
Embedded SREs are responsible of monitoring the jobs during workweek, and during the weekend WT personnel on-call will monitor the jobs.
When HealthCheck Fails
If the job fails the initial action is to send a message in #wt-health-check slack channel and review the logs. 
After the log information is reviewed there are the steps:
Rerun the Health Check
If the Health Check is successful after the second attempt, no additional steps are required
If the rerun fails after the second run, create a DS item and inform the Wicked Tendies team that the issue is under review, and share the DS item. Consult and Escalate as per the criticality of the issue.
Pending Improvements
Migrate reporting to New Relic
Implement health checks for additional jobs
