Previous Quarter Commitments: Full List
 Retrospective
Start doing
Stop doing
Keep doing
Assign stories to devs for 
pre-grooming
 research to reduce reliance on Mark during grooming meetings
Context-switching (engineers can log time or a similar strategy for feedback & understanding where we can create dedicated focus time)
Spikes for bugs 
(often legacy parts of code that takes a LONG time to research)
More dev comments in Jira for updates while working on items to reduce sprint drift
More formalized handoff/communication across teams + externally for changes
Action Item:
 Assign items to devs for pre-grooming
 
 Help reduce sprint drift
 Work on change communications (will be worse with India teams)
Overall comment: research into old/legacy bugs are 
extremely
 time consuming, and often the DS bug report is not entirely accurate. Unsure how to improve..
