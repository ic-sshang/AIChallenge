ADRs are documents that help us remember why we made certain decisions and what consequences those choices might have. Think of them as the “why” behind the “what” in your system’s design.  These are for the team, your future colleagues, and adjacent teams who want to understand.
ADRs must be a sub page under this page and use the 
Template - Architecture Decision Record
 template.
ADRs should be created / defined during the 
Blue Team - AP
 meetings where possible. This provides visibility and valuable input from adjacent teams during the process.
