This report was to categorize the type of changes requested for the ICTemplates project in the past 6 months. Data was extracted on 2/26/2025.
Hardcoded Message
Change on a hardcoded string in the template (Notices, Office address/hours/Personnel, Rates, etc.) .
Field Data With Backend Logic
Modification of fields where the data is calculated/organized/displayed in a specific way more complex than just pulling info from a db field. 
Field Change
Simple swap from one db field to another.
Not Template Related
Pipeline changes / general bug fixes.
Legacy Remote Linking
Change for a different type of bill presentment.
New Field/New Message
Addition of a new field, might include just the value or the descriptor/value.
Field Formatting
Change in format ( rounded/not rounded).
Findings:
Hardcoded message change requests & field changes were of the most prominent requests being 58% of all IC Templates requests. Field Data With Backend Logic are also prominent due to the need for the data to be aggregated or modified before being displayed. Which can cause issues later if new bills contain more, less or different data that wasn’t considered when building the template.
With these findings the initial work should focus on the hardcoded message & Field changes which will take care of more than half of the requests for ICTemplates.
Freeing half of the work done in ICTemplates will give way for sprints to contain less repetitive work while the turnaround time for field swaps or message changes for billers will increase significantly by removing the need for a deployment or an ITG request.
