 Problem
There was an issue with 4 individual returns not processing on CASS’s end which led to Customers not having their money returned back to them. 
 Solution
Stakeholders agreed this was a one-time scenario and we will create a Return File manually and have it processed on the next business day. 
Get the return file where the return record was rejected.
Documentation can be found in the MasterCard RPPS Technical Reference Guide.
Using this example:
“9“ Record - last line in the file.
Blue - Total Number of batches in the file called Batch Count with the size of 6 characters.
Green - Total number of Entry Detail in the file called Entry Count with the size of 8 characters.
Yellow - Sum of all entry detail debit transactions. Dollar value unsigned; $$$$$$$$$ $¢¢.                  i.e: 0000002000 = $20.00
Orange - Batch Number. Size is 7. first 3 characters are left padded julian date followed by (next 4 characters) incrementing number. i.e. if today is Jan. 2 then our julian date is 002. so the first batch header’s batch number is 0020001 followed by 0020002 and so forth.
Purple - TraceNumber - Inverted of BatchNumber ({incrementingnumber}{juian date}. i.e. if today is Jan 2 - 1000002 and then 2000002, etc.
Save the file in RPPS\out\mcrpps and make sure the filename has today's date and there is no .processed extension on the file.
Once the file is there, the MC_RPPS -cassrun should be able to pick it up and send it to MasterCard via FTP.
There are a lot of ways MC can reject the file - please check with the documentation to make sure we are passing in the correct format (Batch Header Record of the Concentrator Send Return).
MasterCard will reject the record if there is a duplicate of the RPPSBillerID, BatchNumber, TraceNumber in the last 45 days.
