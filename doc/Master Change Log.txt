CRM Option #108 - We changed the setting to prevent email address updates coming from the BIF (when bills are uploaded from Insurity to IC). We will continue to allow email addresses to be applied to accounts that currently have a blank email address, but we will no longer update non-blank email addresses via the BIF.
CRM Option #112 and #131 - We changed a setting to prevent email address updates based on the email address provided in our one-time payment route. We will continue to allow email addresses to be applied to accounts that currently do not have a registration.
CRM Option #134 - We changed a setting for payment receipts to only be sent to the email address entered in the one-time payment route.

Apply Global BIF in the Invoicing section of the CRM
Updated the GURU card for Apply Global BIF. 
The Apply Global BIF Customizations should only be used for billers who do not send BIF customization within their BIF file. It will adhere to the setup defined in the Integration Summary.
If a biller is sending some settings in the BIF file and the Apply Global BIF setting is active, the fields included in the BIF file will take precedence over the BIF Customization settings.
The only setting that will directly conflict if active in both the BIF file and the BIF Customization is the InvoiceFormatGUID.

Implementation Marketing Adoption
Talking Points:
Billers who have activated two or more notifications have observed a higher rate of on-time payments compared to those with only one notification. Multiple reminders help keep payment due dates prominent in your customers' minds, thereby reducing the likelihood of late payments.
Moreover, enabling two or more notifications has been shown to assist billers in collecting more payments by the invoice due dates. This can lead to a smoother and more efficient billing process for both you and your customers.
Given these advantages, we highly recommend enabling all three invoice notification emails. This small change could result in a substantial improvement in your billing process.
Added to biller questionnaire.
