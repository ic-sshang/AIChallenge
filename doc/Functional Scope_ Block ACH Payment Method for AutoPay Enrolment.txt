Feature Explanation
🎯 Why This is Needed
ACH payments carry different operational and financial considerations for each biller. To reduce risk or meet compliance needs, some billers may choose to prevent AutoPay enrollment via ACH, while still allowing other payment methods like cards.
This feature ensures:
Configurable control per invoice type
Centralised settings managed from CRM

2️⃣ Payer-Facing Change
AutoPay enrolment using ACH must be enforced consistently in three scenarios:

User Type
Page
1
Payer (Unauthenticated/Authenticated)
CloudPaymentReview Page
2

Other Notes
This is not a common practice yet, so it must be designed with opt-in configuration.
CRM users (internal support or biller-facing teams) should be educated on this new toggle.
