Announcements & Leadership Debrief
Copilot Code Challenge
 – I’m excited to announce the launch of the 
Copilot Code Challenge
 in Q4! There will be a cash award for the individual who best leverages Copilot through innovative usage, community contributions, and knowledge sharing through sessions and brown bags. More details to come next week!
Brown Bags 
– I’ve received some requests for knowledge-sharing sessions, and I fully support these initiatives. Brown bags are excellent opportunities to learn from each other. Martin will be scheduling a couple of sessions between now and the end of the year to share insights from Copilot's experiences. Anyone interested in hosting one has my full support!
