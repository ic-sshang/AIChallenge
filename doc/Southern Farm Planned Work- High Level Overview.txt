Questions from Design 4/24/24
 
  If you wouldn’t mind helping us figure out who is the best person to answer these for each epic? 
Is all this Southern Farm work planned to be custom?
Custom SubTotal work
Will the entire payment flow be in an iFrame on their site, or only that Payment Summary module?  
IFrame
If not the latter, how does that Payment Summary module translate to mobile, where that module currently disappears entirely?
Sorry 
 can you explain further on it disappears?
Is all the work virtual site only? Or also Customer Portal?
both for Pay By Text enhancements
Are there aspects of the CRM and Biller Portal, emails, or any other parts of our product suite affected by these changes?
Yes
For the flow Bethany is working on, which is the forced Autopay subscription using a bank, the changes there potentially affect the Manage Autopay and Manage Payment Method screens and flows, have we considered that? 
 
What is the strategy for Insurance going forward, and is this the first step in moving towards different experiences for different verticals, or just a one-off?
How do the changes being proposed for John's permissions project affect these other projects and screens, if at all? 
 
Are there other pieces planned too for Southern Farm that just haven't been assigned as projects yet? (We need a high level overview)
Not that I know of, but there could be in Phase 2, which would start in Q4
Is there one epic for all the Southern Farm work? I see discrete tickets so am not sure
There are multiple, I’ll list them below shortly
