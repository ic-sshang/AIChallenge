Objective:
Ensure seamless navigation and functionality across all pages in the BillerPortal project after the new library update/BillerPortal Breakout. All navigation links must be clickable and direct users to the correct pages. Existing pages should retain their functionality, including biller-specific features, various payment scenarios (EMV, PayPal, Credit Card, ACH), and OBD matching and finalization. Manual verification should cover all pages not automated, ensuring proper navigation and expected behavior.

Observations:
All the video links under the 
Support -> Training ->Training Videos -> All Links/ Products/ How to/ Technology and Beyond 2090
 section are incorrectly redirecting to a single video titled 
"How to Send a Bill Via Text."
The above is related to the Training video setup in the CRM.  Since this is a demo biller (2689), the video links all point to pay by text.  This is expected behavior and can be ignored.
