Planning
Test Portals
No true test portal. There is one that IMT has on their side where they are able to create fake claims. This requires coordination between IMT and Transcard.
Rules of Engagement
Biller:
Welcome email
Kickoff call
Determine a two (2) week period where the biller would like to go live, with a specific date being targeted.
Unless biller specifically requests, IMT prefers to avoid having go lives at the beginning or end of the month.
IMT:
Email Joel Peiffer, 
joel.peiffer@imtapps.com
 with the requested go live date, but also ask for dates/times within that two week period.
Email 
marketing@imtapps.com
 and 
implementation-team@imtapps.com
 when a new account is created.
Transcard is responsible for sending any credentials to IMT.
