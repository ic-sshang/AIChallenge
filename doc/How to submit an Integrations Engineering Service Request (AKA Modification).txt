This Confluence guide includes instructions for submitting an Integrations Engineering Service Request to the Integrations team, along with a template for the required fields needed to complete the request.
Creating the Integrations Engineering Service Request
Using the 
Service Management Portal
, navigate to the integrations project:
Type of Request
In the 
Integrations
 project, start by selecting the appropriate request type—most DS team submissions fall into one of the following:
General Request:
Use this when the biller is requesting something new for their integration.
Example: A new invoice import/payment export format is needed.
Note: This is not intended for product feature requests. Those should be submitted through the appropriate product request channels.
Change Request:
Use this when the biller is requesting modifications to an 
existing 
integration.
Examples: Adding new fields to an existing PDF template, including additional fields in an existing Datapump integration, or providing extra payment fields in an existing payment exports format.
Report an Integration Problem:
Use this when the biller reports that something isn’t working as expected—this request type is specifically for reporting bugs or system issues.
Examples: Datapump requests include incorrect customer data, or payment export calculations are incorrect.
