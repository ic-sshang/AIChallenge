When there is an SR-Item with changes regarding a configuration in .config files, we need to verify how the change will affect the APM as well as the logging entities/properties for that repo moving forward. This means testing requirements go beyond generating/verifying a successful log file is made.
Example repo: ICRTDRService
To test the full extent of config changes for this repo, we must deploy the branch with the config changes,  configure a devtest BID to use and then trigger RTDR, and make sure a log will be generated from the RTDR trigger. We also need to make sure the log is found in New Relic without manually placing its log file in a folder that will help us see the log in New Relic. Manually getting the generated log to New Relic will not provide all log entities and may also be placed under a different APM name.
(
As of 03/15/2024
) If all the steps are taken to test, we should find our test data in APM name “ICRTDRService - devtest“, after triggering a refresh for the test BID we configured to refresh. 
Logs and log entities
 generated from the refresh using the test deployment 
should be compared
 with production logs to see if any unwanted changes occurred to the log entities and properties. 
https://invoicecloud.atlassian.net/browse/SR-600
 is an example item where config changes were made that needed to be tested. Below are its testing steps found on its testing item:
Deploy [YOUR BRANCH] to QA-Proxy-3.
Using devtest10, 
http://devtest10.invoicecloud.com/crm
 set up an internal test biller to use RTDR:
Turn on RTDR related settings:
Go to Invoicing → Advanced configuration →
Check Realtime Data Refresh
Stale balances - Suppress Balance due
Save
Partner related settings:
In CRM “Profile” tab, set Integrator Partner that is configured in RTDR repo
If partner case in RTDR requires advanced settings, set advanced settings in Advanced settings tab.
In Old term servers (example IP: 10.0.5.6), clone repo ICServicesTester.
In Program.cs, comment out line 19 “EmailTeam();”
Below line 41, add line
IC.ServiceProxies.Services.RTDRService.CallService(n => n.RefreshCustomerByCustomerID(BILLERID, CUSTOMERID, true));
Replace BILLERID value in parenthesis with BillerID configured
Replace CUSTOMER value in parenthesis with existing customerID found in devtest shard.
Run code.
To verify RTDR is being triggered:
Log in to server name “
ic-dbtest-east-server1.database.windows.net
“ in SSMS.
Go to shard configured in devtest.
Check rtdrrequestlogs table for customerID of refreshed customer to verify request attempt.
Check New Relic for logs of refreshed customer.
Test Results:
The following APM page was generated:
 
https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core/apm/overview/MTQ5OTcwNHxBUE18QVBQTElDQVRJT058MTA3MTk1ODc5Mg?account=1499704&duration=1800000&filters=(name LIKE 'devtest' OR id %3D 'devtest' OR domainId %3D 'devtest') AND (domain IN ('APM'%2C 'EXT') AND type IN ('APPLICATION'%2C 'SERVICE'))&state=a3b6d4a3-fb47-92b8-e81f-4ca2d4e518f7
The log below was generated from the test run. In this case we wanted to make sure the APM name was ICRTDRService - devest and also that the 
entity.name
 would appear in the log:
