Introduction
SSLyze is a command line tool that can be used to test TLS protocols, certificates, cyphers and the compliance level of a remote site (similar to Qualys Lab’s SSLScan). The following article will walk you through the process of installing and using SSLyze to test protocols and cipher suites on remote hosts.
Requirements
Completion of the procedure will require an Ubuntu VM, container or WSL instance.
Procedures
Installing Prerequisites
Elevate to root by executing: 
bash
wide
1800
sudo -i
Install the prerequisites for sslyze by executing: 
bash
wide
1800
apt update; apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv
Drop out of the root shell and return to your user session by executing: 
bash
wide
1800
exit
Installing SSLyze into a Virtual Environment
SSLyze require a virtual environment folder to manage the pip requirements. We will be utilizing 
~/sslyze
 (creating in the user’s home folder) in the following section. You may choose to place this in another location (e.g. 
/opt/sslyze
).
Create the virtual environment for the sslyze project by executing: 
bash
wide
1800
cd ~/
python3 -m venv sslyze
Activate the project’s virtual environment by executing: 
bash
wide
1800
source ~/sslyze/bin/activate
Upgrade pip by executing: 
bash
wide
1800
pip install --upgrade pip
Install sslyze into the virtual environment by executing: 
bash
wide
1800
pip install sslyze
Exit the virtual environment by executing: 
bash
wide
1800
deactivate
Using SSLyze
Activate the virtual environment by executing: 
bash
wide
1800
source ~/sslyze/bin/activate
Test a single remote site by executing: 
bash
wide
1800
sslyze my.invoicecloud.com
The scan may take a few minutes to run.  Once complete, you will receive output like the following:
