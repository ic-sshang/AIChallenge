Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Project:
 CIAM – SSO + MFA for Biller Portal
Version:
 Draft v1.0
Owner:
 
 
 
1. Why Are We Doing This
The current authentication model for the Biller Portal does not meet modern identity and access management (IAM) standards. Multiple billers and end-users require secure access but lack consistent enforcement of MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication), configurable brute force protection, and SSO (Single Sign-On) integrations with the Billers IDP.
Additionally, some billers (e.g., BID 3303 – Finger Lakes Fire and Casualty Company) have explicitly mandated MFA as part of their compliance requirements.
Vendor research highlighted 
SecureAuth CIAM
 as a strong fit due to:
Native support for MFA enforcement and multiple authentication methods.
Configurable brute-force lockout features (e.g., 3 failed attempts → 1-minute lockout).
APIs for organization-level onboarding (
CreateOrganization API
).
Enterprise-grade security posture aligned with industry regulations.
This project ensures we meet biller compliance needs, improve user trust, and future-proof our IAM foundation for scaling across phases.

2. Goals / Success Metrics
Primary Goals:
Migrate all the Billers from our IC based authentication to SecureAuth Identity Provider.
Enforce MFA across the billers integrated into the Biller Portal if the Billers would be looking for any of the MFA factors through SecureAuth apart from “Password“.
Centralize authentication with CIAM (SecureAuth) for consistency and compliance.
Provide SSO capability for billers by connecting the SecureAuth to their own IDP.
Success Metrics:
100% of the billers migrated
 to authentication through SecureAuth.
Billers being enabled to have any of the MFA factors through SecureAuth.
Zero billers blocked
 from access due to lack of CIAM onboarding readiness.
<2% of login-related support tickets
 post-migration (baseline TBD).
Measurable reduction in brute-force incidents
 flagged by security monitoring.
3. Scope / Feature Set
Phase 1 – SecureAuth Integration
GOAL:
 Shift authentication ownership from IC to SecureAuth
Prepare to migrate billers from the IC database to SecureAuth.
Build API code components for SecureAuth.
Connect these components to Biller Portal and CRM.
Begin initial migration so Billers authenticate through SecureAuth instead of direct IC authentication.
Phase 2 – Complete Rollout and MFA Enablement
GOAL:
 Enable MFA features for billers
Roll out SecureAuth to all Billers for username/password authentication.
Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) options for Billers based on their needs.
Phase 3 – Post-Migration Enhancements
GOAL:
 Enable SSO features for billers
Integrate third-party IDP connections.
Support Billers requesting SSO through their own IDPs, routed via SecureAuth.
Use Cases
:
IC Biller Admin:
 Logs into Biller Portal with through CRM but is logged as the IC employees themselves.
Biller User:
 Receives lockout after 3 failed attempts (timer-based).
System Admin:
 Creates new biller organization programmatically via SecureAuth API.
End-User:
 Resets password through self-service flow without admin intervention.
Edit: I added this list, but it needs to be further vetted:

5. 
Considerations
Infrastructure:
CIAM infrastructure to be hosted by vendor; minimal infra lift internally.
Most of the Biller Portal and CRM features to work similarly.
Security:
Enforce industry standard MFA (Authenticator App, SMS/Email OTP, push notifications).
Ensure audit trail logging for all authentication events.
Users not able to sign in would only receive a generic message and wouldn’t get a confirmation if the password is wrong or the username, also the users providing the wrong username would be redirected to the SecureAuth route to ensure the security mechanisms enablement through SecureAuth. 
Risks / Mitigations:
Vendor dependency
 → Mitigated with escalation path and SLAs.
Password reset + lockout misalignment
 → Mitigation: monitor via SecureAuth roadmap; apply temporary communication to users.
User adoption challenges
 → Mitigation: Training + clear comms to billers and CS teams.
Other Considerations:
Seamless Slack + GPT integration planned to provide project updates and FAQs within the company.
Phased rollout to minimize disruption; each phase scoped to avoid blocking billers.
