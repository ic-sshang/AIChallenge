The AutoPay/ScheduledPay “chain” encompasses the series of console apps (7) that run daily per biller which ultimately process autopayments and scheduled payments. The chain usually begins at 3 AM CST. People may interchangeably use “autopay job” to refer to the individual step in the chain, the full chain for one biller, or the full chain for all billers. Runs on Azure Batch.
