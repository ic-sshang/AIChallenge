Upon 
 Problem
This exception happens when an RPPSBillerID we receive from the OBD file cannot be matched with a Biller on the IC side. There are two things that usually cause this exception.
OBD was not set to active but we received a payment in the file.
The RPPSBillerID does not match the one we received (usually a typo).
 Solution
The OBD job will automatically send the email to 
boarding@invoicecloud.com
. That email will trigger to create a case number for the exception.
Create a manual file that would be picked up the next day.
How to Create a Manual File
This example is using the #2 scenario (The RPPSBillerID does not match the one we received (usually a typo)).
The application usually sends us an alert either in #dailyobdinfo or our BMS dev channel.
Upon checking the Biller’s Product OBD Setting, we can see that the RPPSBillerID did not match what fiserv sent us.
The solution will be to change the RPPSBillerID in the CRM (by boarding) and create a file for tomorrow's run for that biller. 
Steps to create:
Go to 10.0.6.4 server and find today’s file for MC/Fiserv.
search for the mismatched RPPSBillerID (3XXXXX00) and copy the file’s 101 header and the OBD record of the biller.
Follow the steps here to trigger it for tomorrow’s run.

Notes:
for MC file, make sure you copy the second 101 header. Sometimes they send us confirmation file and we copy the wrong one.
insRPPSEntries checks for duplications by TraceNumber and FileName. If inserting multiple records for the same biller check to see if the tracenumbers are the same.
filename should have tomorrow’s date (YYYYMMDD) or it would not get picked up.
filename show not have a .processed file type or it will not get picked up.
Future Solution 
Stage the entries received and have a UI in the CRM so boarding can assign the entries to the correct Biller.
