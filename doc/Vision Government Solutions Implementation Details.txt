Allow Adjustments on Closed Invoices
Enable this option if Payments and Adjustments can be applied to an Invoice that is considered closed. There are cases in which the recommended functionality is to disable this option. One case is Balance Forward, which by definition the balance of the previous Invoice is adjusted out and moved to the new Invoice. No more payments or adjustments should be allowed on that closed Invoice.
EXAMPLE
Enabled/Disabled
Add any additional context as to why the option is required to be enabled/disabled. Include any specific detail was to what will fail/break if this option is not set properly.

Project Assignment
No integration standard - unique to each biller
Payment Codes 
Some integrations allow billers to specify payment codes (mapped to IC payment sources). Generally will apply to legacy integrations. New integrations are built out with standard codes.
example: Request payment code mapping from biller for IC configuration.
Block CC Flag
Some integrations are configured to a code/value in RTDR to block CC and/or ACH that’s configured by the biller (changes with each biller project). Input details if that applies to the integration. Generally will apply to legacy integrations. New integrations are built out with standard values.
example: Biller configures block CC flag and will need to provide the ‘alert code’ to IC for configuration.
Block ACH Flag 
Some integrations are configured to a code/value in RTDR to block CC and/or ACH that’s configured by the biller (changes with each biller project). Input details if that applies to the integration. Generally will apply to legacy integrations. New integrations are built out with standard values.
example: Biller configures block ACH flag and will need to provide the ‘alert code’ to IC for configuration.
