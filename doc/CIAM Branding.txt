Below is a overview of the branding capabilities in Auth0 and SecureAuth. 
Auth0
The Universal Template supports basic branding elements at the organization level; logo, primary color, and background color.
The Universal Template supports rendering placeholder text elements with authorization context and organization metadata.  Changes here are reflected in all organizations.

SecureAuth
A theme supports basic branding elements at the organization level; logo, primary color, and header color.
Themes support the use of variables to dynamically render organization-specific and authorization context data. For advanced customization, a new theme can be created and assigned to a specific organization. Each organization can maintain its own set of theme templates, allowing full access to modify and update content for tailored, organization-level branding and user experience.

Assesment
True Isolation of Customizations
SecureAuth
: Each organization can have its own theme, completely isolated from others. This means changes made for one organization do not affect any others.
Auth0
: The Universal Theme is shared across tenants or applications unless you implement complex conditional logic, which increases maintenance overhead and risk of regressions.
Benefit
: Reduces the risk of accidental cross-org changes and simplifies testing and deployment.
