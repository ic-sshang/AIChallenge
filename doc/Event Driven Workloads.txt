Scalability
Scale applications based on the volume of incoming events. This ensures the system can handle varying loads efficiently, scaling up during peak times and scaling down when demand is low.
Resource Efficiency
Processing events only when they occur optimizes resource usage. 
Decoupling
Promote loose coupling between components.  Different parts of a system can evolve independently, improving maintainability and flexibility.
Fault Tolerance
By using Azure Service Bus message queues, events are stored and can be retried if a component fails, ensuring that no event is lost.
Flexibility
Different event sources can be integrated with various external systems.
Components
Kubernetes (K8s) Application Spoke Cluster
: The container orchestration platform that manages the deployment, scaling, and operation of containerized applications.
KEDA
: Extends Kubernetes' autoscaling capabilities to support event-driven workloads.
.NET 8
: The latest accepted version of the .NET, used for developing the applications.
Event Sources
: Azure Service Bus message queues
Workflow
Event Generation
: Events are generated by external systems and sent to Azure Service Bus.
Event Detection
: KEDA monitors Azure Service Bus for new events.
Scaling Decision
: Based on the number of pending events or other metrics, KEDA decides whether to scale the application up or down.
Autoscaling
: KEDA interacts with the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to adjust the number of application instances.
Event Processing
: The scaled .NET 8 applications process the events and perform the necessary actions.
