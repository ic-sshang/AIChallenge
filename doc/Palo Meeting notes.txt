Questions for meeting on 4/25/2024
We have two BYOL Panoramas that manage Azure marketplace licensed firewalls, can we migrate those to Flex and it will still be able to manage the firewalls?
Can Panorama push credits to firewalls, if not what is the order for updating licensing model?
Do we apply to Panorama or firewalls first?
If something goes wrong how do we get the system back into production
Do we need to do anything with the API License key for our Panoramas?
Any issues with an HA pair?
