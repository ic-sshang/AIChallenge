Overview
An 
Identity Provider (IdP) 
is a software system that manages user identities and simplifies access to applications. Adopting a central IdP solution presents major benefits to an organization by providing a centralized, secure way of allowing external customers to manage their own user accounts, self-serve password resets, and access multiple systems or product offerings in a standardized manner.
Have you ever logged into a website with your Facebook or Google account? This is an example of an IdP at work in the real world. In the enterprise, common examples of identity providers are Okta/Auth0 and Microsoft’s Azure Entra ID.
Goals
Centralization of sign-in across products
Support third-party Identity Providers, allowing external customers to bring their own.
Simplified Example - Federated Identity
Federated identity removes the responsibility of authentication from individual components and allows authentication to be delegated to a central, dedicated identity provider.
This allows the registration of external SSO providers outside of the company’s network security boundary. 
i.e.
 External users can access systems as if they are on the company’s intranet using their preferred login method.

Glossary
Authentication
 - Who a user is - more specifically, is the user who they say they are?
Authorization
 - What a user can do.
JWT - JSON Web Token -
 An open technical standard for communicating between services using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
OAuth2 (Open Authorization)
 - Is an open technical standard that allows users to login to a system by way of another. (e.g. Login with Facebook, Google, Microsoft) - OAuth2 is specifically concerned with 
Authorization.
OpenId Connect - 
An extension for OAuth2 that allows the capability for 
Authentication. 
Typically, users are granted an identity token through OIDC which can subsequently be used to authenticate and authorize user requests at the API Gateway.
