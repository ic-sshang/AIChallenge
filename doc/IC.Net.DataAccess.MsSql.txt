Objective:
 To briefly describe the usage of IC.Net.DataAccess.MsSql package from MailgunspamComplaints project to access the Data from Database
Summery: 
Please find the detailed description where MailgunspamComplaints accessing data from database with the help of IC.Net.DataAccess.MsSql package 
Master Accessibility
: Accessing Data from master DB i.e. DBMaster_GoldAzure
Here dbo.selActiveBillers is stored procedure in the DBMaster_GoldAzure i.e. Master DB as shown in the above pic
The method uses the _database object (which implements IDatabase) to create and execute a database command.
The command is executed asynchronously with QueryAsync
The final list is wrapped in an ILogicResult<List<Models.Biller>> using the Try helper, which likely handles exceptions and result formatting.
Now lets see how internally IDatabase implements the CreateCommand and QueryAsync 
As shown above the method does not execute the command,
 but prepares it for further configuration as shown above.
Now lets see what will be the implementation of QueryAsync method 
it is calling internally ExecuteQueryAsync as shown above 
Here it will call ExecuteReaderAsync of Microsoft.Data.SqlClient which will access the data then map to list
Shared Accessibility:
 Accessing Data from Shard DB’s 
Here dbo.selCustomerBiller is stored procedure in the all the Shards as shown in the above pic
•	Uses a database factory (_databaseFactory) to create a database context for the specified billerId (sharding).
•	Maps the result to a list of Models.CustomerBiller objects.
•	Wraps the operation in a Try helper, which likely handles exceptions and returns a standardized logic result.
•	Supports cancellation via the provided CancellationToken.
Now lets see how internally BillerShardDatabaseFactory implements the CreateCommand and QueryAsync
Here lets see what does BillerShardConnectionStringProvider do
It will prepare the connection string to the respective BillerId given in the parameter
