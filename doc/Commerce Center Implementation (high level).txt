Epic
High-Level Outcome
Commerce Platform Implementation Prep
Set up Chase Commerce test and production environments
Retrieve API keys, install certificates, configure environments
Review and document API authentication and error-handling strategy
Define internal API standards: timeouts, retries, idempotency, and logging
Payment Flows
Build core workflows:
auth-only, auth+capture {to be updated appropriately}
refunds, voids, reversals
Implement refund handling (full and partial)
Support Digital Wallets (ApplePay/GooglePay..)
 
Support MIT/CIT flows
Securely store and retrieve card tokens using CCP 
(via tokenization vendor – implemented separately)
Validate declines, retries, and edge-case behavior
Operational Tools
Create or update dashboards/admin tools for transaction visibility
Provide traceability between internal systems and CCP transaction IDs in logs
Integrate alerts or notifications for failed or abnormal payments
Testing & Rollout
 
(not necessarily a separate epic but critical for execution planning)
Set up feature flags to control rollout per biller, product, or region
Plan for phased rollout: internal test → pilot biller → general availability
Perform load and latency testing to validate peak-time performance and system readiness
Migration & Transition Planning
Design lightweight routing logic to support dual-platform period
Keep fallback to Orbital available only during transition
Ensure reconciliation and reporting support both systems during overlap
Plan and execute a clean cutover from Orbital to CCP
Minimize dependency on Orbital code paths and retire post-migration
