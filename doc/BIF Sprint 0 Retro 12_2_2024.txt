 Guidelines
Don’t make it personal and don’t take it personally
Listen with an open mind
Everyone’s experience is valid
Focus on improvement, not placing blame
Start doing
Stop doing
Keep doing
Random Thoughts/Music Request
Standardize common code updates (json configs) 
Reserve capacity for tech debt/alert remediation in the sprint.
Size SFP update items smaller, and reserve capacity?
Resize Jira items (story points)
Update the on-call guidebook
Triage needs a guidebook
Keep DB subtasks updated with correct status to reflect progress of story.
Using DMs for comments/questions that would be better served as a group discussion. Put it in the slack channel.
Reassigning INT/ITG tickets without a conversation about whether or not it makes sense.
Starting the sprint with canceled items.
Letting items sit waiting for testing.
Lots of unplanned work, did we underplan too much?
Asking the team for help when stuck
Should blocked items be removed from the sprint or left to end the sprint unfinished?
When will we train other team members on data conversions?
