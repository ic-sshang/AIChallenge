Closing a Pull Request
When closing a Pull Request that has received 2 or more Approvals from the Platform Team Members, please follow the steps outlined below:
After clicking the 
Complete
 button ensure the following options are selected:
Merge type
: 
Squash commit
Delete
 branch name
Create a Tag and add the Title of the PR as the Tag Comment:
Click the Copy button by the PR Title.
Go to the 
History
 of the 
main
 branch to find the last Tag.
Click the 
Tags
 menu item on the left menu and create a Tag incrementing as appropriate using the following Tagging convention:
platform-{platform_architecture_version}/{component_major_version}.{component_minor_version}.{component_patch_version}
platform_framework_version
: The overarching Platform Architecture Version the Tag belongs to.  As we move forward and we want to make major changes to the Platform Architecture we will increment this number and this will allow us to identity which Components work together within the same larger Platform Architecture strategy.
Note, if this is not an Infrastructure or Platform Component Repo, i.e. an Application Repo, then this aspect of the Tag is not needed.
component_major_version
: The Major Version that gets added to the name of the Azure Resources when they are created as the 
Deployment Version
 which is a strategy to enable Blue-Green Infrastructure Deployments.
component_minor_version
: Adding a new Features or behavior in a backwards compatible way.
component_patch_version
: Hotfixes to existing Tags made during the Development and Testing Lifecycle, or a hotfix to a Production deployed component.
