As discussed with the team we want to have a beta phase during this rollout process and identify a few billers who will use this new 1.5x product. The first few billers we identify will need to have SMS enabled and that would have traffic for Pay By Text in the payer portal. (Ex: A recent biller that went live).
During this rollout phase, the team will monitor for Pay By Text enrollment, payments, etc. 
If there are no issues with the 1.5x Payer Portal we will then migrate additional billers with additional features such as SSO (iframe).
The team will continue to monitor the next round of billers and if no issues will roll out to the remaining billers.

Biller Options
Biller options (139) will be used to configure a biller to use the new 1.5 UX for Pay By Text pages in the Payer Portal.  The option is disabled by default and can be enabled for a target biller. 
Cohorts
Biller will be identified by product.   Some of these biller’s will require IFRAME support.
