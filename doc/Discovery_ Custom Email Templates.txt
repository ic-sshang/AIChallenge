Overview
Custom Email Templates feature will allow biller to brand their email communication with custom field and design so that they can align with their compliance and custom requirements. Currently we are supporting template customisation but it's time-taking and not scalable as it's completely manual process. And, this will be self-service so it is going to reduce the requests from the biller for custom template.
Problems
Common Biller Problems:
Templates do not allow enough customisation to match carrier branding.
The fixed fields do not align with branding or insurance needs 
Missing key insurance fields on some templates such as policy number
Inability to brand based on the invoice type
Inability to configure the unsubscribe functionality

Existing Alternatives
Template Updates:
If a biller wants to modify an existing email template, the request is handled by the 
Implementation Team
, who assists with minor customisations as part of onboarding or support.
New Template Creation:
If a biller needs an entirely new template or a significant change, the request is passed to the 
Scrum Team
 (engineering), who then builds it out based on the specific requirements. This process can be time-consuming and creates dependency on internal teams.

User Context & Constraints
Who is configuring the feature?
The 
biller
 (typically an onboarding admin, or implementation specialist) is responsible for configuring email templates within the platform.
What are their goals?
Ensure all outgoing emails 
reflect their brand identity
 (logos, color scheme, tone).
Communicate in a way that aligns with their 
industry or vertical norms
 (e.g., insurance, tax).
Meet 
regulatory or compliance requirements
 (e.g., proper disclaimers, unsubscribe options).
Improve 
customer engagement
 and 
trust
 by sending clear, consistent, and branded communication.
What are their constraints?
No technical knowledge
: They are non-technical users with little or no HTML/CSS experience.
Time pressure to go live
: Email setup is one of the last steps before launch and needs to be fast and easy.
Legal and compliance restrictions
: Templates may need to include required fields, disclaimers, or unsubscribe options depending on the biller's industry.
Limited design skills
: Most users rely on visual cues and need WYSIWYG editing, not code-level control.
What motivates them to use this?
Ability to 
launch quickly and independently
 without filing support requests.
Flexibility to maintain 
brand consistency
 across all customer communications.
Enhanced 
customer experience
, leading to improved engagement, reduced confusion, and potentially higher payment rates.
Confidence that communications are 
compliant and professional
, especially in regulated verticals like insurance.
Emerging Requirements
Stakeholder Feedback/Insight/Requirements
Sarah Books:

Jenny: 
In the scenario where all templates are ready and the biller is reviewing, provide a clear visual indicator (such as color coding or text) to confirm all recommended fields are included, and highlight any missing fields for easy correction.

In Scope – Directly Related to Custom Email Templates
These are valid pain points or feature asks that should be included in this discovery:
Email rendering mismatch: Demo vs Prod
 → template editor required
Custom color scheme
 → template editor required
Update right-hand panel of the editor (field preview/edit)
 → template editor required
Allow to 
customize footer
 of the Email → template editor required
Ability to have template for each invoice types → needs tech validation
Research on easy template creation like
Template Generation from Uploaded Screenshot (Image-to-Template)
 
Import from External Email HTML (Copy-Paste or Upload)
 
“Match My Brand” Automation
 
Library of “Starter Templates” for Common Layouts
 
Not all template markers are available
 for all emails (example: unsubscribe only works with first notification)
Some markers shown but not working
 → needs tech validation
Pulling custom fields into templates
→ needs tech validation
Ability to display vertical-specific fields
 (e.g., parcel number, policy number)-> we might need to figure out a way to mask or some other solution (needs tech validation)
 
Out of Scope
These don’t belong to email template design but should be noted for future collaboration with other EPICs:
Issues related to Test email
→ already tracked in another EPIC (
EPD-277
2278e126-27dc-36c8-aef9-a32d91bc7ad7
System Jira
 )
Use actual biller test data when sending test emails
 → Can be a part of 277
Biller wants to decide which emails to send or suppress
 → relates to notification preference settings, not templates
Configure when to send emails (e.g., business hours)
 → belongs to scheduling logic
Frequency of email delivery
 → again, scheduling logic or delivery policy
Separate SMS/email queues, decoupling
 → part of omni-channel comms or messaging infra

 excels with AMP support, modular reusable blocks, a superior template library, and is ideal if interactivity and template flexibility matter most.
 
BeeFree SDK / Plugin
 offers the most robust enterprise-level capabilities—including collaboration, synced dynamic blocks, and extensive custom branding and requires JavaScript framework integration.
Validation
Should we allow billers to remove core components (like 'Pay Now' button) from transactional emails such as payment reminders?
Suggestion must be their, clearly visible
dynamic placement of component based on template they choose to design
Do we really need 
Collaborative Editing
? Not required.
Should we provide a rich library of pre-built templates? Event based
