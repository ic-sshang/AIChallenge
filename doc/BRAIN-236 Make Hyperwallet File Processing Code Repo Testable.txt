"-localtestmode"
I Added a new command line argument 
"-localtestmode"
. 
Running job with this argument will instruct the job to skip Infrastructure related activities like
File encryption/decryption,
Uploading/Downloading file from FTP,
Sending Email,
Uploading to Blob Storage and
Posting message to Slack.
So that job can be easily tested on local environment without arrangement of dependent Infrastructure and settings.
This argument can be passed along with existing argument Job ID
<JobID: int> <-localtestmode>
example: “5 -localtestmode“
It’s not case sensitive.
The above-mentioned functionality it been implemented for options “OneBatchFileCreation“ and “OneBatchResponseErrorFileCheck“.
“-localtestmode” argument with “OneBatchResponseErrorFileCheck“ Option
For this option the tester/dev need to put a test file in the folder 
”…\repos\ICPaymentProcessingAPI\Jobs\HyperWalletFileProcessing\bin\x64\Debug\
download
”
The file should have correct naming prefix and suffixes
 like “
OneBatch_ICUATPayment0
_20220303_
RESPONSE_ERROR
.xml.pgp”
Also, the file content should contain plain XML content, file must not be encrypted but file extension must have “.pgp“ in the end.
example: “OneBatch_ICUATPayment0_20220303_RESPONSE_ERROR.xml
.pgp
”
“-localtestmode” argument with “OneBatchFileCreation“ Option
The generated file is created in the folder 
“…\repos\ICPaymentProcessingAPI\Jobs\HyperWalletFileProcessing\bin\x64\Debug\
output
“
Developer/Tester need to put a breakpoint inside the code to see the file because the program deletes the file in the end.
