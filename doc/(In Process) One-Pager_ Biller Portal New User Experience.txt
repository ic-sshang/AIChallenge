 Solution Alignment
What is this project about?
The feeling (to be proven) is that new users within the Biller Portal are frustrated by the user experience.  We believe there are several things that are causing this, including lack of training attendance or ineffective training, poor design/usability of the user experience, and lack of dedicated new user focus.
There are dev and non-dev opportunities for us to smooth this process.
Some items discussed:
Launch a pre-release Pendo guide to obtain metrics on new user comfort within the biller portal, and use this data (a) to justify the effort, and (b) as a basis for comparison for after we release updates.  For more details, see the 
Pre-release Pendo
 section.
Publish a “quick-start” Pendo guide to encourage the user to complete specific tasks as a mechanism for coming up to speed, with detailed guidance/training along the way. (think: checkmarks when setting up new fantasy football league) See quick start section for more details.
Encouraging training
Introduce a new “welcome” email when user accounts are created.  This should give “what to expect” / “next steps”.
This overlaps with recent security requirements to eliminate biller admin access to cleartext passwords in the Biller Portal (and IC access in CRM).  See Security updates section for more details.
A second email will contain links to sign up for instructor-led training sessions and self-paced training videos.  The intent here is to get the user into training earlier in the new user process
What other items do we want to include in this email?  Ask Cat/Anita/Mark(?).

What do we want to improve/solve?
Current procedures provide biller portal access to users with little to no training/preparation.
Why do users first log in, what prompts this action?
If possible, may need to validate if new users log in simply because credentials were provided or based on some sort of instruction from IC staff or their superior.
Early portal interactions for new users, either with or w/out training, lack guidance for getting started.
If new users are frustrated, is it the portal/experience in general or something specific?
If possible, may want to solicit additional feedback (open poll) to identify deficiencies to focus on - need to further discuss if appropriate at this stage or as a second layer after X visits/months.
UX might launch a quarterly guide asking users their purpose for using the portal - check on this and/or potentially add a similar question as step 1 of the New User Prep guide.
Project Components
We see three phases of the new user experience with potential for changes to have a positive impact.
Pre first login
Procedures before users gain access to the portal
What happens today (as of Oct 2022)?

 users
Portal credentials are 
not
 supplied by this group
Implementations
Lois and other dept leads attend intake to assign IMs accordingly
IM double checks paperwork, comments from sales, preps smartsheet dashboard questionnaire for biller, 
sends welcome email
Login credentials either provided in welcome email or after kick-off call
Update: As of May 2023, IM enters username & email address only (password reset is emailed to biller) - username included in kick-off recap or 
training email
 post kick off
IM informs billers where to locate training videos and sign up for live sessions
Some integrations require a test portal & production portal, but most are production that start off in demo mode
Demo mode duration varies depending on biller, partner, etc. 
Small/simple integrations typically 45-60 days while more complex is closer to 120 days
No restrictions on adding new users while in demo

Training
IM mainly drives new biller traffic to training
Sends an email to sign up for live training upon go-live announcement

Can/should the procedure change?
Upon first login
User initial interaction with the portal
Provide general and/or personalized guidance to get started
Post first login (ongoing)
Ensure continued success
Provide convenient access to self-help assistance
Facilitate ability to gather sitewide feedback
Considerations
A high-level ‘Biller Portal Overview’ video(s).
Highlight different areas of the portal (where to go in nav menu) and how to access the KB.
Possibly tailored to user persona with option to view other user persona based videos.
Video followed by a series of prompts or guides to walk users through what we believe are the most critical tasks they will need to perform.
If possible, we can track which tasks are completed/incomplete and display statuses to each user.
Resource Center to collect open-poll style feedback on a per page basis.
Need to research and determine if able to identify which page is associated with the feedback.
Quick-start guide
Open questions:
Where are the users struggling, and what tasks should we have them perform to address those areas?
These tasks are likely to be tailored to the type of user (CSR vs account vs admin vs ?)
Are we able to determine the user’s role(s) before they login?
If not, give them multiple choice roles/tasks to pick from, and these selection will dictate which quick-start tasks we present to them.
Some options include:
Is this something we can do exclusively with Pendo?
We’re unable to display a constant Pendo guide (i.e., automatic guide that does not dismiss to show a list of relevant KB links) on the same page as any other automatic guides that may be desired - only multiple badge-driven guides can be used simultaneously or in conjunction with a constant guide.
Pendo won’t have status persistence to facilitate showing completed vs incomplete tasks.
For these reasons, we believe this needs to be a DEV project.
Research if/how the Pendo “Resource Center” feature may be able to help:
https://support.pendo.io/hc/en-us/articles/360031866712-Resource-Center-Overview
 
Limited to one RC per app (i.e., only one RC can be created for the Biller Portal app)
Customize modules and guides within the RC with segments and page locations to control which users see what and where 
A user must be an eligible visitor in the module segment and guide segment for both the module and relevant guide to appear in the RC for that user
If a user clicks the RC badge on a page where a guide is not located, said guide does not appear as an option within the module - it will appear only when the RC badge is clicked on the guide’s designated page
Potential to create poll response segments to dynamically target user persona, but this method relies on users having provided a response which is largely unreliable
RC does not interfere with standard guide display

Make external links to Knowledge Articles work with login
 (article on ideaexchange from 2012 – still open!) – 
is this relevant/a concern?
Need to put together some mockups and start discussions with BMS and Design teams.
Security updates
Biller Portal users have access to PII, partial PAN, can manipulate financial transactions, they are in scope from a PCI perspective and need to follow industry standards
Admins should never see/edit user passwords
Passwords should be salted hash on the backend, no decryption possible
Password field should go away, be replaced by a “reset password” feature
Upon new user creation, user receives a welcome email with username and temporary login link
Login link expires after X mins, need to determine what’s acceptable based on discussion with CS, I’m thinking a few hours
If link expires, admin can resend email which will provide new link
User is directed to a “set your password" page, follows data validation rules
Upon creation of password, redirected to login page
Same password page will be used if user is sent “reset password” email
On new/edit user page, should we require the admin to provide role details / common tasks?
Review password policy details and verify with SecCom team that they’re still accurate
Ensure that we’re actually enforcing these policy details
Make sure to include proactive messaging when password expiration is upcoming
Usability of new user page
Double entry on key fields, less in-your-face validation rules
Product/mkt will help with messaging and delivery of new “feature” to billers
These same requirements need to apply to the CRM UI as well (no IC admin seeing cleartext passwords)
These same requirements need to be reviewed for payer user accounts as well
Why are we doing it?
