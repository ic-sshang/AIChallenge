Random Thoughts/Music Request
better solution for making and tracking the ADA stories
proactive towards problems - a 15 minute solution doesn’t cut it
When to schedule demos/ communication on when ready to view, even partial.
Better onboarding for new team members (product, process, etc)
Subtask for prototyping, so I can add notes to the Jira ticket for better context in hand-off
Start coding without adding x-rays. +1
reactionary to alerts and their causes
neglecting AP/SP checks before 10:30am
 
 
team helping on urgent bug, questions, quickly +
adding steps to reproduce/testing steps/acceptance criteria to engineering tickets +
weekly check-ins with design prototypes
helps me (Bethany) iterate in the right direction
Working as a team and covering each other’s backs
The team has been very gracious and helpful with getting links for Garrett and Bill while we wait for access - TY
Shoutout as well for all the help getting us onboarded in general. (Learned a lot more with this hands-on work than with the video trainings)
