Overview - Request to create an enhanced version of the Customer Utility changelogs usually found under an individual Biller’s CRM page. Our Client Service members struggle to piece together a timeline of events to changes made within the customer's profile, settings, and invoices. This will reduce the DS tickets related to changes made for a customer, autopay, paperless, etc.
Add a new page in the CRM under the Tools > Biller Tools tab to consolidate changelog information in a chronological view. New search functionality will be added so that Client Services can choose the Biller without going to the Biller CRM Profile to search for a specific customer account.
The new changelog page will include more details as to who, what, when, and why the change was made as a complete view of the activity within the customer's profile for a comprehensive timeline of events.
A collaborative effort between Client Services, Development Support, and Other engineering teams.
Description - This tool provides an area to consolidate changelog information in a chronological view from newest change to oldest.
