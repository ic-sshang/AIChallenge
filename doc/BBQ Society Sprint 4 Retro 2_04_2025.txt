Random Thoughts/Music Request
Being more efficient with sprint refinements +2
Maybe add a timer? 
  Or assign an item someone to look at before? 
 
Find ways to increase grooming efficiency
Keeping notes as items are ‘dissected’? ← this
Start our own documentation officially and maybe even have bi-weekly reunion to talk about it and standardized processes. +∞
Cowboy coding :bonk:
Please ensure whatever BIF file provide for testing should work appropriately
Start Logging any alert caused by biller changes on their Bill Presentment Process (Filenames/Different Pages numbers/Bill Format Change)
Cowboy code? (-1, there will always be a time and place i.e. putting out a fire quickly. Trick is to recognize when it is appropriate) - I agree, love cowboy coding. (-1 it depends)
“Sharing is Caring” - Don’t pick up items you’re familiar with all the time (speaking for myself - Chris). Let the team work on items that would be new to them. This helps by letting others learn the repos and processes better. +1
 
Keep in mind smoke test for unusual changes before the release day.
“Don’t be scared homie” - Keep being excited about learning new things and tackling new problems alone at first.
Informal Smokehouse meets
Ask more experienced developers on opinions about SOLID principal and other relevant OOP principles. 
meeting at smokies
