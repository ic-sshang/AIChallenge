Name Comparison Tool
 - This tool allows you to compare two names (strings) and see the similarity score in real time using various algorithms.

Scoring Algorithm
Values between the two Jaro-Winkler scoring methods with an average  >= 90% OR either of the scores is >= 98% we will update the name.  The rest we will convey, even if we place the row in the queue
Jaro-Winkler Similarity​ Scoring 
How It Works
​
Match Characters
: Find matching characters within half the length of the longer string​
Count Transpositions
: Count characters in different positions​
Calculate Jaro Score
: Based on:​
Number of matches​
String lengths​
Transpositions​
Add Prefix Bonus
: Extra points for matching characters at start (up to 4)
Score ranges from 0 (completely different) to 1 (identical)
Jaro similarity is calculated as 
(m/s1 + m/s2 + (m-t/2)/m)/3
, where m=matching characters, t=transpositions, s1&s2=string lengths.​
Winkler modification adds 
(l * 0.1 * (1 - Jaro))
 where l=length of common prefix up to 4 characters.
