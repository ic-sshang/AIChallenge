Hosts File Excerpt
Post-Provisioning
The hosts file sets up custom DNS records for a specific server. Because of its server-specific nature, it will need to be configured post-deployment rather than saved in our golden image.
We’re trying hard 
not
 to use the hosts file for anything going forward. To do this, we’ll need to ensure that all required entries from 
a dump of hosts file content from the production web servers on 2025-01-28
 are configured as proper DNS records in private DNS zones. 
Even after doing that, we’ll still need a few hosts file entries - but only a few. The reason these are required is that they aren’t FQDN’s and would not be possible to recreate as DNS records.
Here are the required records. Note that the 2 actual IP’s in this block are for production and would need to be updated for other environments.
10.0.3.52 icservices           # proxy load balancer IP
10.0.6.21 icservicesskybot     # IP for icskybot2 VM
127.0.0.1 clouddb              # not sure what this is
127.0.0.1 www.invoicecloud.com # self reference
One thing to confirm: 
this removes all of the web servers' self-references. Today, domains like 
www.invoicecloud.com
 are mapped to the web server’s own IP address rather than the public endpoint or app gateway. Setting the hosts file like this would change that behavior. Need to confirm that that’s alright.
