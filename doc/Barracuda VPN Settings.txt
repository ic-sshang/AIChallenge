Settings on your VPN could make a difference on how you tunnel to our systems. By default, I believe it sets up as UDP or Hybrid. This document will walk you through checking and switching.  
You will need to disconnect from VPN before doing this if connected already.
 
Need to go into VPN settings, right click on the client icon in the bottom right of the windows toolbar. 
Once open click “click here button at the top highlighted in yellow to open in admin mode. 
In Admin mode you will select the VPN setup profile and select Edit Profile
Check to see that Tunnel mode is set to Reliability (TCP) 
If not set to this setting, please change it. Save it.
Connect to VPN and monitor.
