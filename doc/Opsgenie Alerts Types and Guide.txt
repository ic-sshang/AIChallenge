This document helps find documentation and work done for Opsgenie alerts. 
The process to create an alert documentation item can be found below:
How-to Document an Alert as an SR-Item
 
To search for documented steps to solve alerts:
Copy the name of an Opsgenie alert title up to/before the run number.
Paste the copied title onto the search on Jira.
If the alert has been documented, SRE Altimetrik items with similar titles will load.
Open an item and review the description and steps to resolve under the comments to verify if the issue is similar to the alert on hand.
Example of exisiting documented alert items:
