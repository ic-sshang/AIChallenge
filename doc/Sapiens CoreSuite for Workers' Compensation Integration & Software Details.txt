CloudPay
Supported
CloudPayV2 is supported for the below CloudPayV2 Use Cases: 
One Time Initial Payment for Payroll Report Premium in Sapiens Portal

Sapiens completed development on One Time Payment for Quote Initial Deposits CloudPayV2 Use Case, but they did not have a Partner Level environment for Invoice Cloud to test the One Time Payment for Quote Initial DepositsCloudPayV2 use case. Sapiens advised they will potentially engage Invoice Cloud in Q1 2026 to test the One Time Payment for Quote Initial Deposits. One Time Payment for Quote Initial Deposits CloudPayV2 Use case is not supported in the integration until it is successfully tested.
