Introduction
This is a .NET worker service deployed in the Biller Kubernetes cluster. It runs continuously, pausing for 10 seconds (tentative) between iterations. The service reads unprocessed Datapump records from Biller shards and publishes them to Azure Service Bus in near real time.
Reads pending record counts from the Datapump metadata table in the perflogging database, then connects to relevant Biller shards with updates.
KEDA 
scaling is driven by metrics exposed via biller-datapump-api, enabling the worker service to autoscale according to the message backlog for Azure Service Bus publishing.
Running the Job
The job does not require any parameters by default but supports optional parameters to control its behavior. It utilizes the 
Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration
 framework and adheres to its standard conventions. This Connects to the Azure Service Bus with Rebus Package and Scales based on the message count from the metrics server and publishes the event. Configuration values can be provided in multiple ways, with the following order of precedence (from lowest to highest priority):
appsettings.json
 entries
Environment variables
Operational Details
Query Pending Datapump Records from Biller Shards
The job queries the 
[DataPump]
 table in the Biller Shards to retrieve the records to publish onto Service Bus.
Once the message is published it will update the DPStatusMetadata table in IC_Perflogging Database.
