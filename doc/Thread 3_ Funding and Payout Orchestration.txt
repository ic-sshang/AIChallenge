Medium Rocks (MVP vs Day‑1 vs Future)
How to Read the Table
Rows = Capabilities (Big Rocks)
 → Each row is a core capability (e.g., Wizard, KYC, Funding Config). Marked as 
Must
 or 
Should
 from workshops.
Columns = Phases of Readiness
MVP = Regulatory Baseline
 → Minimum controls required by Chase/regulators. Manual, Ops-driven. Goal: 
Legally live
 (1–3 billers).
Day-1 = Operational Baseline
 → Minimal automation to support ~20 billers. Light UI/API builds. Goal: 
Operationally viable
.
Day-90+ = Optimization & Scale
 → Efficiency, self-service, advanced integrations. Goal: 
Reduce manual work & scale growth
.
Color Codes in Cells
🔴 
Net-New Dev (High Effort)
 – API, service, or UI build.
🟡 
Partial Dev (Medium Effort)
 – CRM config, vendor API, workflow extension.
🟢 
Ops/Policy (Low Effort)
 – Manual workaround or process only.
Open Qs / Decisions / Blockers
 → Tracks unresolved items, dependencies, and next steps.
Estimation
Effort (S/M/L/XL)
 = raw build/test work.
Complexity (Low/Med/High)
 = cross-team, integration, vendor/Chase risk.

Open Questions / Decisions / Blockers
CIS Delivery Gate for Funding
Funding only after transactions are 
sent to CIS
. Use txn-level flags and reporting. 
MoSCoW: Must
.
🔴 Enforce policy: 
no funding if txn not sent to CIS
. 
🔴 Txn-level 
sent_to_cis_at
 field drives batch eligibility. 
🔴 Provide 
Undownloaded/Unverified
 and 
Batch Deposit
 reports.
🔴 Automate CIS tracking across cohorts. 
🔴 Exception queues for CIS posting failures.
🔴 Event-driven CIS confirmations. 
🔴 Predictive detection of CIS drift.
Decision:
 Block funding if CIS posting fails (vs. only delivery)? CFO stance = block. Needs biller comms plan.
Funding Orchestrator & Batch Cadence
Orchestrator job applies eligibility rules, creates instructions, generates NACHA. 
MoSCoW: Must
.
🔴 Nightly batch job (T+1). 
🔴 Eligibility: approved + CIS-sent + Deposit Delay met + FBO balance check. 
🔴 Idempotent NACHA generation baked in. 
🔴 Retry handling for rejects included from MVP.
🔴 Configurable payout schedules (daily/weekly). 
🔴 Holiday calendars, partial payout handling. 
🔴 SLA: funds available T+2.
🔴 On-demand/expedited payouts. 
🔴 Multi-window cadence (e.g., same-day cutoff).
Blocker:
 Treasury file spec + certification with Chase.
Funds Routing Rules & Templates
Templates define principal, IC fees, reserves, chargebacks routing. Driven by MO#. 
MoSCoW: Must
.
🔴 Template schema implemented. 
🔴 For pilots: principal to biller, IC fees via daily debit, refunds netted. 🔴 Apply only after FBO funds available.
🔴 Cohort-level templates. 
🔴 Validation & approval workflows.
🔴 Multi-account splits (rail/invoice type). 
🔴 Policy versioning & simulations.
Important Note:
 MO# shopping cart allocation. Chase only echoes one MO#.
Settlement Mode Config (Gross / Net / Daily Fee Debit)
Determines payout + fee model. 
MoSCoW: Must
.
🔴 Core logic in MVP. 
🔴 Pilots on 
gross + daily fee debit
. 
🔴 Net settlement supported for Amex aggregator.
🔴 Governance: cohort-level policies, validation rules, maker–checker approvals.
🔴 Per-invoice/rail granularity. 🔴 Premium fast-funding, risk-tier based modes.
Blocker:
 Finance to set Day-1 cohort defaults.
Exception Handling & Rejects
Handling for payout failures (ACH rejects, CIS failures). 
MoSCoW: Must
.
🔴 Ops playbooks 
and retry logic for soft rejects baked into MVP
. 
🔴 Reports highlight unfunded txns (undownloaded/unverified). 
🔴 Manual re-issues for hard rejects.
🔴 Ops dashboard with root-cause codes, automated queue mgmt.
🔴 Predictive exception management, ML-assisted resolution.
Decision:
 SLA for clearing exceptions (1 biz day?).
Eligibility & Compliance Checks Before Funding
Gate payouts on KYC/OFAC/in-good-standing checks. 
MoSCoW: Must
.
🔴 Pre-payout checks built into orchestrator (KYC, OFAC, compliance flags). 
🔴 Manual override logged.
🔴 Automated evidence capture + SLA queues.
🔴 Risk-tiered rules (velocity limits, reserves auto-adjust).
Decision:
 Which checks are hard vs. soft gates at MVP.
Reserves & Holdbacks
Ability to withhold % or fixed amounts based on risk. 
MoSCoW: Should
.
🟡 Placeholder fields in template. 
🟡 Ops spreadsheet-driven tracking.
🔴 Ledgered reserves, release schedule, audit trails.
🔴 Risk-based dynamic reserves, scenario simulation.
Decision:
 MVP include toggles vs. wait until Day-1.
Ops & Finance Reporting
Reports for payouts, exceptions, reconciliation. 
MoSCoW: Must
.
🔴 Deposit-centric reports from IC data + CIS flags (batch vs. undownloaded/unverified).
🔴 Ops dashboard linking NACHA ↔ deposits ↔ txn sets.
🔴 Bank-statement ingestion for auto-match.
Note:
 Bank pulls considered future scope.
Funding Config UI
Ops UI for templates, modes, schedules. 
MoSCoW: Must
.
🔴 Minimal screens/admin forms for pilots. 
🔴 Audit logs included.
🔴 Full UI with validation rules, maker–checker workflows.
🔴 Bulk changes, simulations, “what-if” modeling.
Blocker:
 Governance model for Ops approvals not finalized.
