 
Overview
This document proposes a new feature that gives billers the option to defer AutoPay runs when Real-Time Data Refresh (RTDR) fails. Currently, AutoPay proceeds even if RTDR fails to return a balance. This can lead to unwanted collections or inaccuracies. The proposed feature introduces retries on RTDR failure and only proceeds with AutoPay if RTDR succeeds.
However, when RTDR fails, we’re faced with two choices — both with consequences. Let’s walk through both scenarios:
Scenario 1: We Collect the Payment (even without updated balance)
✔️ Payer avoids late fees, penalties, or service disruptions
❌ There’s a risk the collected amount is incorrect
🔄 Biller may need to issue a refund or adjust future bills
Scenario 2: We Do Not Collect the Payment
❌ Payer may be late, face penalties, or have service interrupted
❌ Biller must reach out manually to collect missed payment
🧾 Recovery becomes harder, especially if payer is unaware
While both have drawbacks, 
Scenario 2 (not collecting payment) creates a more serious impact
 on the payer and adds operational burden for the biller. That’s why our current system attempts to collect even if RTDR fails.
Some billers prefer accuracy over risk. To support flexibility:
We are proposing this feature as optional
It can be enabled per biller based on their risk appetite and business preference
Existing RTDR-Related Configuration Options
Before proposing the new AutoPay-related enhancement, it’s important to clarify the current capabilities tied to RTDR:
🔹 Option 61: RTDR - Block Payments on RTDR Failures
Description: For billers with RTDR, if enabled, if the RTDR encounters an error and is unable to retrieve the current balance, the customer will not be allowed to make a payment.
This option is 
Off
 by default
AutoPay is not included in the scope of this option.
🔹 Option 64: RTDR - Override 6 Hour Previous RTDR Check
Description: For Billers with RTDR, we normally would not pull a RTDR Balance if we had a successful balance within the past 6 hours. Enable this to Force a refresh.
This option is 
Off
 by default
AutoPay is not included in the scope of this option either.
🎯 Objective
Provide billers with greater control over AutoPay behavior.
Prevent collection of potentially outdated or inaccurate balances.
Introduces retries for Autopay on RTDR failure
Clarify the scope of Option 61 and Option 64 by stating that autopay is not included in these options.
Notify user on failure even after retries.
 
Proposed Flow
Must Have:
 Push all pending autopay due to RTDR failure to manual queue
Move to manual queue due to RTDR failure
Should Have: 
Introduce a retry logic on RTDR failure before initiating AutoPay.
Retry logic on RTDR failure before initiating AutoPay.

⚙️ Configuration Behavior
A new biller-level configuration option will control this behavior.
Default: OFF (AutoPay will continue as today)
When enabled, AutoPay will only proceed if RTDR succeeds.
Retry for Autopay on RTDR failure
Must Have: 
Push all pending autopay due to RTDR failure to manual queue
Should Have:
 Introduce a retry logic on RTDR failure before initiating AutoPay. Retry attempts and duration will be defined during implementation/discovery.
Notify biller or player if Autopay fails even after all the attempts
Must Have: 
Connect with Autopay Failure Report(subscription required for biller) in the biller portal
Could have:
 Notify via email to biller. (for Payer, we don’t have any template)
📊 Metrics to Track
To evaluate the impact and behavior:
% of AutoPay runs defer due to RTDR failure - DB request
Average retry attempts before success
Time delay between first attempt and successful RTDR (not valid for Must Have approach)
Number of successful autopay payments after retry vs deferred runs - DB request
Refund rate comparison (pre vs post feature adoption) X- no way to measure
🧠 Open Questions
How many times should RTDR retry? Is there a max duration (e.g., until EOD)?
What should be the retry interval?
Do we notify the biller/payer when AutoPay is defer?(+1)
Should there be logging or alerting (internal) when retries exhaust without success? (newRelic can be used)
Do we want to allow a different behavior for $0 balances?(-1)
