Backlog Health
The backlog has been averaging around 18.6 which is within the normal range (15-20) for integration tickets.
MTTR (by priority)
https://invoicecloud.atlassian.net/jira/dashboards/10393?maximized=28340
Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) – July 2025
Highest Priority:
 3.8 days
High Priority:
 7.3 days
Medium Priority:
 9.3 days
Low Priority:
 7 days
In July, MTTR increased across all priority levels compared to YTD averages. This may be attributed to a higher concentration of bill presentment-related tickets, particularly those involving PDF importing and linking, which tend to require a higher time investment. These tickets may have contributed to other tickets aging before resolution, leading to the overall rise in MTTR.
Additionally, we recently experienced a staffing change in our US and India office, losing 2 team members and currently training another one, who is new to the integrations space. This transition may have impacted overall throughput and contributed to the MTTR increase.
Although resolution times were above our 5-day target, the increase from June to July did not reflect a major spike, and escalated tickets remained under 5 days—indicating that critical issues continued to be resolved promptly.

Since the beginning of the year, a total of 508 tickets have been reported in the integration’s space, highlighting various issues across different services:
Bill Presentment
 is the most frequently reported service, with 145 tickets. Among these, 
39 tickets
 are related to 
PDF Extraction
, accounting for 
27%
 of all Bill Presentment issues. This high percentage indicates that PDF Extraction is a critical area within Bill Presentment that requires attention. 
About a quarter (
27%
), of all integrations tickets are classified as additional information, which implies that these are mostly research conducted to answer questions.
These insights reflect that Bill Presentment and File Processing are the critical areas for integrations and the ones producing most of the toil.
Ticket Volume Analysis
https://invoicecloud.atlassian.net/jira/dashboards/10393?maximized=17894
In July, a total of 76 integration-related tickets were resolved. Of these, 27 were specifically related to bill presentment, and 18 to file processing; that would account for 36% and 24% of tickets respectively. 22% of the work for this month could be classified as research given the mitigation actions of additional information. Only 7% of tickets were actual defects in our code, and 9% were request for code changes. This data indicates that most of the team's time was spent conducting code analysis to help CS navigate integrations for biller’s/SP.

Next Steps
Once the PDF Bursting Tool is complete, we will begin discovery for the 
PDF Manager
 (Idea).
Here's some context from a previous presentation:
Problem
:
PDF linking has become a bottleneck, consuming time and computing resources. These tickets often require manual intervention from Dev Support (DS), slowing resolution and diverting focus from higher-impact work.
Solution Strategy
:
We're developing tools to streamline PDF-related processes and reduce DS ticket volume by shifting ownership to CS and eventually to billers.
Bursting Tool
: Splits large PDFs into smaller, manageable segments.
PDF Manager (Idea)
: A comprehensive tool to handle all PDF-related needs for billers, enabling CS to manage requests independently.
Long-Term Goal
:
Shift PDF-related responsibilities from DS → CS → billers to:
Reduce ticket volume
Improve turnaround times
Free up DS for more complex engineering tasks
Action Items
Finalize and release the PDF Bursting Tool.
Continue research into PDF Manager and AI Agent opportunities.
Review new file processing tool in the CRM
