Today we manually update the public TLS web certificate for *.invoicecloud.com on Cloudflare, Barracuda WAFs, and the individual web servers.
Only the Cloudflare certificate is accessed by the public, and is a more risky change than the others.
Cloudflare provides a public certificate that can be a wildcard cert or specific URL.
The steps to move to CF managed certs:
Set the date of the migration
Notify the customers and include link to root/intermediate certificates (test domain for them?)
Run through the migration on 
ic-rob.com
 domain and document each step
