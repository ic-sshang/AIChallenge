These are common issues observed when reviewing code.
Testing
✔️ DO test every single line of code.
✔️ DO include unit tests for baseline and new features.
Do
Data Types, Declarations and Variable Definitions
✔️ DO define the data type explicitly.
✔️ DO use camelCasing for variables and method parameters.
✔️ DO use ALL CAPS when declaring constants. (IC standard)
✔️ DO use PascalCasing for all other identifiers.
✔️ DO use proper data types when making declarations.
Do
 Avoid declaring variables as 
object
.
 Avoid declaring variables as 
string
 if they do not contain string data.
Avoid
❌ DO NOT abbreviate variable names. 
❌ DO NOT include the data type in the variable name. (Variables named after database columns are the exception to this rule)    
Do Not
 Examples (Visual Basic)
vb
Dim shouldShowPassword As Boolean = True  
Dim loginGuid As Guid = Guid.NewGuid()  
Public Property BillerId As Integer  
Public Function GetBillerGuid (billerID As Integer) As Guid
Do
Functions
✔️ DO use a verb in the function name to describe what it does.
✔️ DO aim for the function to perform one task: typically either "doing a thing" (process) or "getting a thing" (query).
✔️ DO check for unintended side effects, especially when modifying class objects.
✔️ DO use return values instead of output arguments.
Do
 Avoid using numbers to create uniqueness in function names – e.g.  
ACHFileProcessing2()
Avoid
ASP Control Naming Conventions
✔️ DO use camelCasing.  
✔️ DO include the abbreviated control type in the variable name.  
✔️ DO keep the control name consistent when retrieving it via the FindControl() method.  
Do
 Examples (Visual Basic)
vb
<asp:TextBox ID="txtUsername" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>  
Dim txtUsername As TextBox = Page.FindControl("txtUsername")
Do
Variable Validation
✔️ DO use String.IsNullorWhitespace() when checking strings.  
Do
❌ DO NOT use string length as validation for an empty variable.  
Do Not
Optional Parameters
✔️ DO pass optional values as named parameters in function calls.
Do
:info:
atlassian-info
#E6FCFF
Examples (isDemoBiller is an optional parameter)
Dim shouldShowPassword As Boolean = GetPasswordSetting(billerID, isDemoBiller:=True)
Conditional statements
✔️ DO perform any inexpensive logic before database calls. Sometimes calls can be avoided based on the condition.
✔️ DO use guard clauses to throw exceptions or exit the function. This avoids deeply-nested logic.
✔️ DO use short-circuit evaluation (
AndAlso
 and 
OrElse
 in VB, 
&&
 and 
||
 in C#). Be aware of the effect on function calls in the conditional statement.
Do
 Examples (Visual Basic)
vb
If IsValid Then
   'Do Stuff
Else
   Return ErrorCode
End If
Do Not
If Not isValid Then
   Return ErrorCode
End If
   'Do Stuff
Do
Continuous Improvements
✔️ DO delete unused items if it does not affect current functionality.
✔️ DO refactor long statements into smaller parts.
✔️ DO function out repeated code.
Do
Content Visibility
✔️ DO default to 
Visible=False
 when logic is used to determine visibility of the control.
✔️ DO use an 
asp:PlaceHolder
 to define displayable content with HTML.
✔️ DO use 
asp:Literal
 to define displayable content without HTML. (Text only)
Do
❌ DO NOT use an 
asp:Panel
 to define displayable content.  The contents in a panel will render in a div and could cause alignment and styling issues. Use a placeholder instead.
Do Not
Exception Handling
✔️ DO write to a log or send an email when handling exceptions.
Do
❌ DO NOT catch exceptions if you aren't doing anything with them. 
Swallowing exceptions this way makes debugging more difficult and can lead to unexpected behavior.
If you need to throw an exception from inside a 
Catch
, use the 
Throw
 statement (by itself, without any variable) to preserve the stack trace.
Do Not
Modifying Web Methods
✔️ DO verify the return object serializes into XML or JSON the same as it did before.
For example, if a pre-existing method was using GetDataSet, don't switch it to GetDataTable without understanding the repercussions. Tables within that dataset may
have dynamically assigned names and changing how it is built could affect the XML structure once serialized.
Do
Consistency Measures
✔️ DO be consistent when naming classes, methods, parameters, and variables. 
✔️ DO be consistent when writing error messages and referencing product names.
Examples:  
When referring to DataPump, avoid writing it as "data pump".  
When naming methods or clases, follow standard naming conventions. If one doesn't exist, follow the common practice.
✔️ DO define page init and page load methods at the top of the class, just below the field and property declarations. Page init should come first.
