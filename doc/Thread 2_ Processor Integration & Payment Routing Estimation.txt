Processor Integration & Payment Routing
Level of Effort Assumption
Level of Effort (LOE) estimates
 represent the approximate duration required to complete work, based on a typical delivery team of 3–4 resources. These estimates assume that teams can execute the work without external dependencies or constraints.
With a typical team size, the estimated level of effort is:
X-Small
 – Approximately 
0.5 month
Small
 – Approximately 
1 month
Medium
 – Approximately 
2 months
Large
 – Approximately 
3 months
X-Large

Chase Commerce Payments API
Stand up new card processing with Chase Commerce (Visa/MC/Disc/Digital Wallets) so IC can act as a PayFac. Start small with pilot billers and build a path to scale to hundreds of billers with Chase as the default processor.

{Chase will be providing a separate creds to access commerce related dfr files}
Chase field mapping TBD. Finance policy on recon cadence pending.
Merchant Order Number (MO#) Strategy
{To be revisited after a deep-dive discussion with other stakeholders}
Define a universal transaction ID (MO#) to enable routing, reporting, and reconciliation across Chase and non-Chase rails. This is the anchor key for Finance, Ops, and Biller reconciliation.
Note: Why MO# Matters So Much
Single source of truth
: It is the only 
universal transaction ID
 across Chase Commerce, non-Chase rails, IC ledger, and Finance Ops.
Primary join key
: All downstream reconciliation (settlement ingestion, exception management, Finance dashboards) is done on MO#.
Hard Chase limit
: Only one MO# can be echoed back per txn, 
max 40 chars. Api supports 40chars but reports 22 chars.
That’s a constraint we must design around.

Net-New Dev — Functional:
 Finalize MO# spec

unique across Orbital + Chase).
