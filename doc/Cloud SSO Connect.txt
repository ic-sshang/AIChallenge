Preface
What information do we need to be included in the ticket?
If the biller resolved the issue, can we get details of their resolution? A brief note of the issue and mitigation action on their side.
Can we document the troubleshooting steps to check if CRM options are the problem?
Questions For Triage

Resolutions
Cloud SSO
Case 1: Iframe page not loading
When it comes to past issues associated with an Iframe not loading up correctly in portals such as Silverblaze/Capricorn. The issue can sometimes relate to the URL that the portal jumps to when directing towards invoice cloud’s domain. 
If an account is available to login into, the page can be 
inspected
 to view its network component where the URL the Iframe is trying to load will provide information on its formatting.
The image above provides an example of the inspector being used, by going unto the network tab then filtering towards ‘doc’ to only show the pages and then we can check the URL the portal is redirecting to so it can load the Iframe. Do note that the inspector needs to be active when the page is loading, or it might not capture the information.
In this situation the request URL is set as:
https://www.invoicecloud.com/portal/remoteauth/customerportalredirect.aspx?
instead of:
https://www.invoicecloud.com/portal/remoteauth/customerportalredirect.aspx?RemoteAuthenticationToken=token&ViewMode=value&RedirectID=value&CSSUrl=value
Leading to an empty page due to the remote authentication token not being present. Biller or software Partner are known to set up this URL and can review where they implement this token in the request URL to resolve the issue.
Case 2: Blank Iframe Special Characters
In other cases where the iframe page will not load can stem to how a request is sent over to the remote authentication API.
The request would usually involve an email address or username along with a password and optionally a CssUrl. If the URL request is not encoded properly, special characters such as “+” or “&” sign may not be transferred appropriately preventing a remote authentication token from being generated and not loading the iframe page.
E.g. request with a non-encoded email: 
email+name@email.com
E.g. request with an encoded cURL email: 
email%2Bname@email.com
Case 3: Iframe No Available Invoices
In the scenario that a customer is unable to view invoices on their account, it may be due to a conflict from other logins associated either through the username or email address. To remedy this issue, removing the login by unregistering the conflicting account can resolve the issue.

SAML
Case 1: CRM Activate Product
Check if Cloud SSO connect product is active on CRM and SAML settings configured
Case 2: Blank White Screen callback settings
When setting up the SAML settings on the billers end, if they are misconfigured it can lead the jump over to our domain providing a blank white screen. 
This can be checked to make sure the Biller has their SAML callback settings set similar to the image below:
Case 3: New Relic Search
New Relic APM → 
Azure - SSOAuthentication - production
Searches within the logs portion of new relic and possible timeframe can help find the type of exceptions thrown which can allude to possible SAML misconfigurations.
Image below shows the search for a specific Biller. If an error is found check around that time frame a minute or two before and after to see additional information on what triggered the error.
Case 4: Open Invoice require + sign to view after portal redirect
Upon a redirect to invoice cloud customer portal if the customer is not able to see their invoices and have to click the + sign to view them, the issue may stem to the link redirect which would require a filter id of “1”
Quick example:
Invoices default view → 
https://sso.invoicecloud.com/saml/[token]ViewMode=0&DeepLinkID=19&FilterID=1
Expanded to view invoices → 
https://sso.invoicecloud.com/saml/[token]ViewMode=0&DeepLinkID=19

Helpful information can be found in the URL whenever the user gets the error message when accessing the Support Central. Common errors are:
“
PORTAL_USER_ALREADY_EXISTS_FOR_CONTACT+Api+Exception
” 
 
In this case, a similar username exists in the system. A solution would be to change the username.
“
Invalid contact
” 
For this case, the user might have an incorrect username related to account. E.g. unnecessary underscores in username. A solution would be to update the username.
“
Username change is not allowed
”
 
Similar solution as above.
“
Duplicate community nickname in insert
”
 
As the error states, a duplicate community nickname exists which must be updated.
Sometimes the error description might be empty or no error description show
