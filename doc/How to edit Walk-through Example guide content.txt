Considerations
Preview Template
note
First, watch 
Walk-through Example
 in preview mode to understand output and interaction with this type of guide, and consider the following, as it relates to the new feature/product:
Determine if a walk-through guide is warranted
Determine how many guide steps will be required
1
Determine if automatic activation is necessary, or if only a target element or badge is needed
2
Target element (pre-existing page text) or a Pendo badge is required
Automatic should be limited primarily to new pages/products

TIP
:  Alternatively, a Payment Reconciliation public guide can be viewed from within any live Chase-only biller portal with at least 3-day-old settled batches, by accessing the page and clicking “
here
” below the title - 
this guide was implemented prior to application of template branding, so its use of logos and various designs is outdated and should not be replicated
.
1
 A step-by-step guide should provide benefit and as much needed guidance as possible, but please keep the user experience in mind, and 
limit the total number of guide steps to 10
.
For difficulty limiting steps, create a Jira issue on the 
UX/UI Board
 for product design team assistance.

Automatic activation guides must be coordinated
.  It is strongly recommended to only use either a target element (pre-existing page text, similar to this example), or a badge, for activation.
Edit Guide
Editable guide elements are outlined in the following steps - no other modifications should be made without consent.
Modify Activation (recommended)
note
Cloning the Walk-through Example template, defaults guide activation to “AUTOMATICALLY, TARGET ELEMENT“.  Most often, automatic activation must be disabled, and set to either target element or badge.  It is best to decide on activation before proceeding.
Plan to use badge activation?
  See the requirement below.  Also, to avoid delays, continue to edit/build the guide while waiting for the badge-activation setup.
