Proposals for enhancement of Retry Mechanism
Implement 
exponential backoff
 for retries to prevent overwhelming services.
Provide a 
UI in the CRM portal (DataPump Management screen)
 to configure retry mechanisms dynamically.
Use a 
database-driven approach
 for storing and managing retry configurations.
Standardize 
retry logic based on HTTP status codes
, ensuring consistent and optimized retry behavior.
