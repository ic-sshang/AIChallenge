The proposal is to create a new service to integrate into the Commerce Center APIs. CTP will determine when to call this new service and process the response. The new service will only handle the communication with the Commerce Center while CTP will still be responsible for the other core payment features such as IC Standard Validation, Bin Validation, Recording Payments (???), Queueing Emails, and Datapump.
