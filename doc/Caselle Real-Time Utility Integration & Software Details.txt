We will support the option of creating a lockbox file for cloud store invoice types. The file can be transmitted to the biller via Stratus or delivered via e-mail but they will need to manually import the file into Caselle. Any addition or changes to Caselle’s cloud stores will require and ITR to make sure that all items are set up with the corresponding GL#.
