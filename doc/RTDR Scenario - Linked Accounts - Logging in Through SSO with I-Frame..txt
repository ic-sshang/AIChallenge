For billers who log in through through the method mentioned above, RTDR logic can be found under the MyIIS repo under the Master.CustomerPortal.master.vb.
As of 03/10/2023, for RTDR to be guaranteed to run successfully for a group of linked accounts, the account total must be 5 or lower. This can be verified by going into the definition of LinkedAccountsRtdrProcessor, on line 277.
The integer, maxNumberOfAccountsToLoadSequentially, is currently set as 5.
Scrolling down to RefreshCustomerGroup, the logic shows that any number of linked accounts going through RTDR past 5, is very likely to cause a TooManyLinkedAccountsCallback.
You can trigger RTDR for a group of linked accounts using the following steps: 
In the biller portal, go to the profile of a customer that is in a linked account group.
Go to the Users/Email tab
In the tab, Click on the highlighted icon.
If the number of linked accounts is under 5, RTDR should run successfully over all accounts.
You can verify if RTDR, ran for a number of linked accounts by using some of the queries below.
sql
full-width
select * from customers where accountnumber = 'PCO0000164'    --obtain the customerid for the account accessed

select * from mcl.customerlogins where customerid = 10499     --obtain the group loginID and the customerloginID
select * from mcl.logintypes                                  --this query will show the roles for the logins queried above

select * from mcl.customerlogins where loginid = 4154         --querying with Group Oversight LoginID will show all linked accounts
select count(*) from mcl.customerlogins where loginid = 4154  --this will show just the number of linked accounts

select * from mcl.loginuseractivity where loginid = 4154 order by daterecadded desc --This will allow you to find the exact time of your login attempt.
select * from rtdrrequestlogs where customerid = 10499 order by daterecadded desc   --This will allow you to find if RTDR was triggered.
^--You can also run the query above with any customerid that is under the linked account group (query in line 6).

--Compare the login date records with the RTDR request logs. If the times are very near, RTDR ran.
--If there are no RTDR records around the time logins happened, it has not been triggered. This is likely because the group of linked accounts is over 5.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--If you would like to check if RTDR has/will run when logging in for other groups of linked accounts use queries below
select * from mcl.customerlogins where loginid <> 4154 and logintypeid = 4 order by loginid --replace the loginid, this will help find other groups of linked accounts
                                                                                            ^--find a group of linked accounts and pick a loginID
                                                                                            
select * from mcl.customerlogins where loginid = 3683                 --pick an account (customerID) to check it's login and RTDR history
select * from customers where customerid = 7468 --account in group    --using the account number you can verify in the biller portal if there is group login activity in the customer activity tab

select * from rtdrrequestlogs where customerid = 10935 order by daterecadded desc --compare the RTDR request logs for this customerid (or any that is part of the loginID group.)
select * from mcl.loginuseractivity where loginid = 3683 order by daterecadded desc --compare the login times and dates with the RTDR request logs.
