Allow Adjustments on Closed Invoices
Enable this option if Payments and Adjustments can be applied to an Invoice that is considered closed. There are cases in which the recommended functionality is to disable this option. One case is Balance Forward, which by definition the balance of the previous Invoice is adjusted out and moved to the new Invoice. No more payments or adjustments should be allowed on that closed Invoice.
