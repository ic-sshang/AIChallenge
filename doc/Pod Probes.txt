Intro
Kubernetes (K8s) Pod Probes are a fundamental feature of the K8s Container Orchestration Platform.  They provide the ability for the K8s Container Orchestration engine to:
determine if a Pod is ready to accept traffic after Pod creation (Startup)
determine if a Pod becomes overwhelmed with a previous request and needs to be taken out of the Load Balancing Pool (Readiness)
determine if a Pod becomes totally unresponsive and needs to be recycled (Liveness)
Probe Summary
Startup Probe
Purpose:
 Checks if the application has started successfully.
Timing:
 Starts after an initial delay and runs periodically until it succeeds.
Behavior:
 Stops running after it succeeds once. Specifically for the initial phase after pod startup.
Probe Endpoint Behavior: 
The application/workload endpoint that accepts the Startup Probe request(s) and responds back.  
This endpoint should check for connection and access to all resources the application/workload is dependent on to ensure the application/workload will work as expected once the Pod starts having traffic routed to it.
  Logging for this Probe Endpoint should be verbose to make it easy to troubleshoot issues if the Pod never passes the Startup Probe.  
Readiness Probe
Purpose:
 Determines if the application is ready to handle traffic.
Timing:
 Starts after an initial delay and runs periodically.
Behavior:
 Continues periodic checks during the pod's lifecycle.
Probe Endpoint Behavior: 
The application/workload endpoint that accepts the Readiness Probe requests and responds back.  This endpoint should only really respond back to the request and not do additional checks since it is expected that the timeout for this Probe will be very short as 
this Probe is used to determine if a Pod needs to be momentarily taken out of the Load Balancing Pool.
  Logging should be limited as it is expected this Probe will run very frequently. 
Liveness Probe
Purpose:
 Checks if the application is alive.
Timing:
 Starts after an initial delay and runs periodically.
Behavior:
 Continues periodic checks during the pod's lifecycle.
Probe Endpoint Behavior: 
The application/workload endpoint that accepts the Liveness Probe requests and responds back.  This endpoint should only really respond back to the request and not do additional checks since it is expected that the timeout for this Probe will be very short as 
this Probe is used to determine if a Pod has become unresponsive due to Memory or CPU exhaustion from a rogue process or procedure inside the Pod.
  Logging should be limited as it is expected this Probe will run very frequently. 
Probe Configuration
path
 and 
port
 for HTTP request.
initialDelaySeconds
 the number of seconds before a Probe sends its first Request.
periodSeconds
 the number of seconds between Probe Requests.
timeoutSeconds
 for Maximum time in seconds a Probe will wait before it determines the application/workload has registered a Probe failure.  A Probe may allow for multiple failures before taking any action or totally failing.
successThreshold
 the number of successful responses before a Probe Success is registered and further action is taken by the K8s Orchestration engine.
 
failureThreshold
 the number of failed responses before a Probe Failure is registered and further action is taken by the K8s Orchestration engine.
