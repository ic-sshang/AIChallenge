Invoice Cloud Web Services
The information in the Invoice Cloud Web Services section reflects the information provided to Invoice Cloud at the time of Discovery and Design. It is possible for this information to be updated at any time by a biller or CIS Vendor without notifying Invoice Cloud.
This Grancius portal contains 2 different versions of Cloud Pay V2.  If a biller is using external charge codes, EMV readers are not supported and the biller is considered to be on version 1.  If expense codes are not used, version 2 of Cloud Pay V2 supports EMV readers.
Sample Fee Code screen illustrating no External Charge Code associated with Fee Code.
