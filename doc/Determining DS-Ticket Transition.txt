For tickets in which the resolution is for new functionality to be added, there is a gray area in determining if a   ticket needs to be closed with CS submitting a
 Product Request
, the ticket is transitioned to a 
Solutions Architecture Item
, or the ticket is transitioned to an
 Integrations Engineering Service Request
. The purpose of this document is to help determine what a ticket will be transitioned to depending on its conditions met.
(ITG) Integrations Engineering Service Request:
If a ticket is in the integrations space (RTDR, Datapump, File Processing, Exports), but it 
does not
 involve the software partner, it recommended for the ticket to be transitioned to an ITG.
(SA) Solutions Architecture Item
If a ticket is in the integrations space (RTDR, Datapump, File Processing, Exports), and it involves the software partner, it recommended for the ticket to be transitioned to an SA.
Product Request
If new functionality is requested, and it does not fall in either of the two scenarios above, a product request will need to be submitted.
