Britecore Main Branch

Integration Requirements and Pre-Requisites
Biller needs to have a Britecore test portal configured and the IC integration enabled
This will be done via a Zendesk Ticket with the Implementation Worksheet provided for the integration values (see below)

Test Portals
IC Hosted Test Portal - Not Supported
Partner Hosted Test Portal - Britecore does not have a generic test space to connect to an IC instance. Each Britecore test portal must be setup, specific to each biller. These test instances are re-purposed at Britecore so once the integration is live, the test instance is eliminated.
Web Service URLs - Domain and API key are unique per biller
Rules of Engagement
The customer will submit a Zendesk ticket to Britecore stating that they would like to setup a test portal and integrate to InvoiceCloud. This Zendesk ticket should include a link to the Implementation Worksheet where Britecore will provide the biller domain and API key. This request should also include an invoice file for coding.
Biller needs to submit a Zendesk ticket to their CSR with the 
Implementation Worksheet
 to setup a test instance of Britecore and provide the sample BIF and biller’s domain and API key for RTDR. 
InvoiceCloud IM’s need to let BriteCore know if a client is a submitter and what the services fees are
Invoice Cloud Coding Requirements
Standard IC Integration Coding Form: Britecore to provide the biller's domain and API key for RTDR on the 
Implementation Worksheet
. Britecore will also provide the biller invoice file.
