Summary
This API based payment integration allows 3rd party applications to utilize a "Pay Now" button within their application to redirect the user to the Invoice Cloud Payment Route where they can enter in all the payment information and submit the payment. Once the payment has been approved, the IC Payment Route will display a printable receipt and provide a method to return the user back to the calling application.
There are two versions CloudPay v1 and CloudPay v2.
