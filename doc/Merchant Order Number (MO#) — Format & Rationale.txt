1. Format
Structure:
BID (6 digits) + Terminal (3 digits) +
 Transaction ID (up to 13 digits)
Max Length:
 22 characters (per Chase requirement)
Examples
0038010010000001234
003801
 = BID
001
 = Terminal for Utilities
0000001234
 = Transaction Sequence
0132610020000005678
013261
 = BID
002
 = Terminal for Property Taxes
0000005678
 = Transaction ID
2. Purpose of MO#
Unique Transaction Identifier
Each transaction is traceable back to a biller (BID), a merchant account (terminal), and its transaction record.
Alignment with Chase
Chase requires InvoiceCloud to pass a merchant order number with each authorization; max length = 22 characters.
Reconciliation Backbone
MO# serves as the cross-system key across Chase settlement files, CRM, billing, and reconciliation.
Compliance
Encodes hierarchy so MCC, TIN, and descriptors tied to a terminal can be linked back for 
1099 reporting
 and 
KYC
.
3. Rationale Behind the Structure
BID
Ties every transaction to the biller entity.
Terminal (Invoice Line)
In PayFac design, terminals = merchant accounts.
Each terminal captures MCC, soft descriptor, and TIN (needed for compliance and reporting).
Invoice types can map to different terminals if they need different MCCs or funding accounts.
Transaction ID
Provides uniqueness at the transaction level.
Keeps sequence generation simple and scalable.
4. Shopping Cart Handling
All items in same terminal
 → 1 MO# / single payer debit.
Items across multiple terminals
 → multiple MO#s / multiple payer debits.
Future option
 → allow single payer debit by defaulting to the 
primary MCC
 (highest-volume MCC for the biller).
⚠️ 
Validation Needed (
 
)
How frequent are 
“mixed MCC” shopping carts
 (e.g., utility + tax + permit in one cart) vs. 
multiple payments of the same type
 (e.g., 3 utility bills)?  
This analysis will confirm whether 
primary MCC consolidation logic
 is required now or can be deferred.
5. Summary
MO# = BID + Terminal + Transaction ID
 (finalized across sessions).
Shopping cart logic
:
Single MO# if all items under one terminal.
Multiple MO#s if spanning multiple terminals.
CRM design:
Terminals
 = merchant accounts; capture MCC, descriptor, TIN.
Invoice Types
 = control funding instructions (bank accounts).
Transaction Holds:
Alpha:
 manual/DB toggle.
Future:
 Ops UI control.
