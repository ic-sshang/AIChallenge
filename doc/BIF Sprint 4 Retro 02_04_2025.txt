 Guidelines

Listen with an open mind
Everyone’s experience is valid
Focus on improvement, not placing blame
Start doing
Stop doing
Keep doing
Random Thoughts/Music Request
Practice making items as small as possible
Address alerts that are still open after a period of time, even if not on-call
Groom 1 item after standup (temp)
Instead of bringing in small items in during sprint, take that time to groom other items
Review BIF alert windows/priority notification
Push for required reviewers on repos that we own +1
Scheduling more time for grooming
Bringing in documentation items for alert handling
Assigning testers during standup
Looking for different areas/ways to improve upon the codebase.
Protip: Don’t be not rude to the ai chatbots
They’ll mess you up - quoth bruised Tyler
At what priority should an alert be alerting over-night?
