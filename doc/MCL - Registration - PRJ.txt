Identified Technical Problems
Unregistration process is inconsistent across software functionality
Handled inconsistently – logins can be removed which leaves temporary logins – the temp logins can fail to unenroll from services
Lack of documentation on what the defined processes are for unregister/re-register operations based on where it is being done (i.e., Biller Portal UI, Customer Portal UI, Agent Connect, APIs, etc.)
The first owner (there can be only one owner on a customer account) that is linked to a customer account is what drives the account state as being registered.  A removal of the owner, creates a (empty/login), unregisters the account.  This action removes all other logins first and then removes the owner and creates the (empty/login).
