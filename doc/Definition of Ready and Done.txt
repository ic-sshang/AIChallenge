DoD Examples: One Type Doesn’t Fit All
Having a single type of a Definition of Done that will apply to every situation is impossible. A User Story, a Sprint, an Epic, or a Release each have their own unique DoD. Some example scenarios:
Definition of Done for a feature (User Story, bug, tasks)
Definition of Done for a sprint (all features, stories, tasks, bugs in a given sprint)
Definition of Done for an increment (a releasable version of a product - major/minor)
 Definition of Ready for Dev/Test - User Story/Bug/Task
Add your tasks for the day below. Type // to add the due date, and type /status to add a status lozenge.

 Definition of Done  - User Story/Bug/Task
Each User Story carries a set of Acceptance Criteria that, if met, define the user story as ‘done’. In general, both the Definition of Done and the AC for User Stories have to be written before the actual development starts so that the team can capture all customer needs beforehand.
