Proposed solution
Turn off Arlington Website on the MCC Server IIS.
Add Load Balancer in front of the 2 MCC Servers.
Ensure Routing to send traffic thru Firewall from IC Web Servers to the MCC Load Balancer from Step 2.
Change this to only Internal traffic via HOST file entries on the IC Web Servers for Non-Standard Port and go from the IC Web Servers to the MCC Servers thru the Firewall and Load Balancer thereby avoiding the need to support non-standard ports in Cloudflare or Kong.
Still need to support

 in GoDaddy and route thru Palo and Kong.
