There is no official Windows distribution of Docker apart from 
Docker Desktop
, which is not what this article is about. This article is about 
Docker Engine
, also known as Docker CE. Installation and execution of the Docker Engine via CLI must take place on a Linux machine: in our case, on 
WSL 
running on your 
AVD
. 
This article assumes you already have an AVD, and that you’ve already installed and configured WSL on it. Depending on the Linux OS you chose to install when you set up WSL, the steps to install Docker Engine may differ. See 
this
.
Uninstall all conflicting packages
