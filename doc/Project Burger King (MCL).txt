Problem Summary
Customers face challenges with both 
Multi-User Login
 and 
Account Linking.
 Current user experience gaps make it hard to manage linked accounts and multiple users effectively.
This results in 
confusion, inefficient account and user management, and security risks,
 requiring manual intervention from internal teams (Support and Data Services). To address these issues, we must enhance existing Account Linking and Multi-User Login functionality and introduce new features that simplify and strengthen overall account management.

Root Problems
Issue
Product Gaps
Pay by Text only works at the Account level (note: PBT and SMS are tightly coupled)
AutoPay enrollment is blocked during 1-time payment route for MCL
Paperless is at the account level and not set by users
Unable to save phone number or payment method from IVR because we don't know the user to save it to
Payment blocks are at the account level not the user level
Not all users receive all email notifications despite the code saying they do
Lack of operations from the Biller Portal for non-Account Owner users
Lack of visibility in the Biller Portal for user actions
If a Biller wants to remove or add a function to a user role they cannot in today's system
Unable to identify Owner versus Tenant in our system
User Registration Issues
Payers do not properly un-register and re-register their login email addresses and there is no option to transfer account ownership
Registration occurs without verifying payment methods
Registration occurs without authorizing user type and the 1st person to register assumes Account Owner role
System does not require unique email addresses for logins using that auth type (60 out of 220 MCL Billers)
Rigid User Type Permissions
Not all User Permissions fit all needs and scenarios for our Billers' customers (Captive agent vs Independent agent)
Our product lacks competitiveness in the Insurance space for agent users
Bandaids have been put in place to address User Permission needs for Insurance space and does not provide a best-in-class experience (e.g., creating user level permissions as API parameters to pass through in individual requests – this does not scale for large Carriers)

Problem
Impact
Root Cause
Unlinking accounts removes AutoPay and Paperless 
Payers unexpectedly lose AutoPay and Paperless enrollment when accounts are unlinked in biller portal
Unlink action in biller portal unregisters all accounts in linked group 
Difficulty Identifying Owner vs. Tenant
Difficulty identifying owner/parent accounts vs tenant/child accounts causing confusion for the biller and payers
Linked account implementation lacks consolidated account management and selective unlinking
Linked account balance display issues
Payers see only a single balance without breakdowns for each linked account, causing confusion
Customer Portal displays combined balance rather than per-account breakdown 
Linked account payment method sharing without consent 
Payers can access and use another account's saved payment method 
Payments can be shared across linked accounts without validation

MCL Technical Interview - ALL
 
Area
Description
Account Linking/Unlinking
Account linking behaviors are inconsistent across software components
Different APIs
 (REST, SOAP, SAML, Agent Connect, etc.) 
each apply different business rules
 for login creation and linking
Lack of defined behaviors
 for account linking/unlinking that the business should follow
There is a 
difference between linking customers and linking logins
 in our system. A login can be associated with multiple customer accounts – unregistering affects only the specific customer-login relationship. This can lead to complex scenarios. 
Multiple customers linked together: 
A: 1 to many relationship 
B: Many to many relationship 
Removing a login can unintentionally break links or associations with customer accounts & can result in unclear ownership of payment methods
Manual work is required for linking/unlinking accounts, inconsistent linking logic across different software components
Custom jobs and RTDR-based linking are still in use creating multiple variations in behavior across integrations
Creating a Login
These scenarios create a login but each has different way of making decisions to create a login & different decisions to 
link logins
 together.
Scenarios when a customer account is created i.e., Customer Login:
Cloudpayments
Cloudpayments v2
Paperless imports (CRM Tool) 
Customer imports (CRM Tool) 
Autopay imports (CRM Tool)
SSO - SAML
RemoteAuthentication (SOAP)
ICRemoteAuthentication (REST) 
CSRConnect (AgentConnect)
ICRestAPI (Various endpoints support Login Management + Customer Creation) 
KioskAPI (not sure on workflow but it does support creating a customer + login) 
Login Type Behaviors
Login type behaviors are inconsistent across software components
Notification logic is tied to login type IDs and not permissions
Reliance on hardcoded login type IDs is spread across the code, is inflexible, and there are hidden behaviors 
(this could be problematic to deal with if we introduce custom login types)
Co-owners: Currently, when removing a login in the biller portal, if the biller allows co-owners and one co-owner customer login is found, that customer login will be promoted to an owner customer login. This logic is not present when removing a login from the customer portal. We would need to determine which of these two cases is the correct logic and search for similar logic across our other repos and libraries.
Email Update Behaviors
Email update behaviors are inconsistent across software components. There are many endpoints to update emails all with cascading impacts. 
Email updates can retain or expose old payment methods, depending on how unregistering or ownership change is handled
Invoice imports
 update emails differently depending on CRM options (e.g., Collier example with Biller Option 108)
The 
Customer Import Tool
 does not respect multi-user rules
Emails are updated without proper validation of account ownership roles
There is no easy way to import new email addresses without breaking things 
Marketing does not have a tool for their Paperless, AutoPay or Adoption campaigns
Biller Portal email changes can unintentionally reassigning payment methods, ownership or mistakenly unlink accounts
CRM options can update emails with unintended impacts
Thorny logic around when we should update email addresses with multiple Biller Option configuration permutations 
Registration & Unregistration Process
Registration & unregistration process is inconsistent across the application
Handled inconsistently – logins can be removed which leaves temporary logins –  the temp logins can fail to unenroll from services
CRM configurations can modify registration behaviors e.g., Biller Option 122
By default, the Remote authentication API does not register a customer if a group oversight user is registered to an account that has no account owner. By design, the Api will create a login for the user, hence why a successful response is generated, but the account itself is never registered. However, if a biller uses biller option 122, we will create the group oversight login and register the account when the Api is called.
Code Link
Registration can happen in multiple scenarios: Biller Portal UI, Customer Portal UI, Agent Connect, Remote Auth API, etc.
Lack of documentation causes confusion & isolated research is needed when support cases, bugs, product requests arise
Orphaned Records & Temp Logins
Orphaned records can occur from unregistering an account tied to AutoPay and RSP
Scenario: 
AutoPay is at the customer level but requires a login. There is a login associated to the account for AutoPay and it can be disassociated with the login resulting in AutoPay without a payment method 
Temp logins create DB headaches – they can be manipulated without proper validation (i.e., tying a payment method to a temp login during registration that doesn’t belong to the user registering), and can lead to account takeovers
Invoice imports sometimes create empty logins or logins without proper ownership
Email Notification gaps
Hardcoded logic determines who receives what notifications, this is 
not determined by 
permission sets – this can lead to mismatches between expected vs actual notification recipients
It is not clear what user types receive what email notifications, nor are these notification recipients defined
Email notification logic is spread across various libraries and the email queue processing system 
Example: Within
 IC.Logins 
there’s lots of logic around who gets notified for some emails i.e., who gets a notification, who gets a receipt, who gets copied (courtesy email), who gets reminders, etc. 
Duplicate emails across logins
This can happen if an email address is changed for one user to another via the Biller Portal, and it can happen in webservice calls from SSOs
It can also happen if we've created a user to do a Paperless or Autopay conversion
We do not have any guardrails in place to require unique email addresses for logins
This causes ownership confusion, security risk, and operational errors
This is an issue with the username having different passwords. The root cause is NOT MCL. This should be addressed separately and they need unique usernames. Low usage but there could be some big Billers that this issue occurs on. Decrypt pw and run a report to get a sample of Billers that have this occurrence. Are these two records with the same email address? 
We must stop this from happening. We need to determine if we can remediate users in this state or only stop this from happening moving 
forward
.
Database Challenges
Manual database interventions 
– DB team spends 5-10+ hours per week on linking/unlinking accounts due to inadequate tooling. This is inefficient and also requires manual support from CS teams leading to Billers waiting days or weeks for issues to be resolved.
Different parts of the application handle multiple logins differently leading to manual intervention/analysis from Data Services
Example 1
CustomerA is tied to Login1 with EmailAddress
CustomerB is tied to Login2 with the same EmailAddress
In the DB, CustomerA and CustomerB are not linked – these are tied to 2 separate 
Login Records. 
In other parts of the app, CustomerA and CustomerB are linked.
Scenario: Add a linked account
Biller: These 5 accounts are linked. Request to add a 6th account. 
DB: the accounts are 
not 
linked – there are 5 accounts tied to 5 different 
Logins 
sharing the same email address. 
Which Login should we tie this 6th account to? Should we tie them all to a single account now? If so, which one?
Saved payment methods are tied to 
Logins
By moving accounts around, we potentially remove/grant access to a set of payment methods
Each request must be analyzed for potential security implications
Not all parts of the process log changes – when updates happen we:
Cannot pinpoint why/how these changes occurred
Cannot revert changes when requested
Example 2 
It is possible for 1 email address to be tied to multiple Customer Logins. This is not an ideal situation.
Scenario:
 
A Biller requests to link account 12345 to the following already linked accounts: 67890, 67891, 67892. The username/email associated with these accounts is 
Username@somewhere.com
 – but account 12345 is already tied to a Login with a password where the email address matches the one referenced and linked to 67890, 67891, and 67892: 
Username@somewhere.com
. In this scenario, all 4 of the accounts should already be linked. 
MCL High-level Overview
What is MCL?
Multi-Customer Login
 (also called 
Multi-User Login
) lets more than one person sign in to a Customer Account
The 
Account Owner
 or 
Co-owner
 can invite other people and set their user type (Account Oversight, Guest, etc) which determines what they are allowed to do
The user roles are: 
Account Owner, Co-owner, Account Oversight, Guest,
 and 
Group Oversight
Each role has certain things they can and can’t do
What product features are associated with MCL?
Many Billers with Multi-User functionality also use 
Co-Owner
 (Option 78)
Co-Owner 
is another user role
From the Payer’s perspective, there is no difference between Account Owner and Co-Owner – they are both Owners
From the CRM, the Biller can decide how many Co-Owners are allowed on a Customer Account
How many Billers use MCL?

Overview
The supported model is a 
multi-tenant, role-based access system 
with the ability for 
linked accounts.
A User has one Login*, and that Login can be linked to multiple Customer Accounts. 
The User role (e.g., Account Owner, Account Guest, etc) and permissions define what they can do within each account.
*A user has one Login but there are scenarios where many Logins are created with the same email address. This is a documented issue.

Support Issue Cases
Support Cases - Multi+User & Co-owner
Summary
Negative support cases point to 
system rigidity
 (inflexible role rules), 
high manual intervention costs
 (bulk spreadsheet processing), and 
risk of unintended authority changes
. They will likely require both 
UX fixes
 (clearer role management tools) and 
policy changes
 (better control over automated role reassignment).

Problem Patterns Identified from Support Cases
Role Removal Limitations
Owners and co-owners cannot remove one another, leading to stalled cases and manual intervention.
This becomes problematic during policy changes, account transfers, or user disputes.
Automatic Role Changes Creating Confusion
When an owner is unregistered, the oldest co-owner is automatically promoted to owner without explicit admin control or notification — leading to unintended authority shifts.
Bulk Ownership Updates via Spreadsheets
Many cases request mass uploads or removals from lists, which is error-prone and time-sensitive.
Timing differences between reports cause misalignment between system state and intended changes.
Dependency on Email as the Sole Identifier
Multiple cases show reliance on email address matching to determine account ownership — causing errors when emails change or are reused.

Notes
Account Based System vs Invoice Based System
Account linking processes need to be simpler with ability to make bulk edits or individual edits e.g., unlinking 1 account out of 150 accounts linked
The DB structure including account owners, co-owner, etc.
The design of the tables is good and should be maintained in a new world
How we leverage the tables could be updated/simplified/etc
Configurable user permissions – Biller can set up the user types and assign those permissions
If we could do 1 thing to be in a better position, build custom user types per Biller. Not all Biller use cases fit into our current user structure/login types.
Group Oversight was not designed with agent persona in mind
Separate creds for AI agent
User types that meet Billers needs per vertical, Payers needs
Can we stop forcing Account Owner as the first user type
Why do we force Account Owner?
To manage the users
DB requirements force a single Account Owner
Separate registration flow for landlord or non-Account Owner user types; the system was not designed for Landlord as the Account Owner
The original design was Landlords register through a file type uploaded via SOAP API NOT via Customer Portal or Biller Portal
Login file is not very common; Biller cannot self-service this
Authenticate the user’s identity type i.e., Landlord, Practice Manager vs Tenant, Insured
Permissions schema
Default permissions are set – everyone baseline and level of access is promoted based on how they authenticate themselves
If we want to upgrade 
Are there more functions that should be considered in the permissions? 
Paperless might need to stay at the account level
4 users on the account and 3 of these users do not enroll in paperless but 1 user does – do we send 3 paper bills to the same address?
CIS systems do not always handle user level data
Storing user data at the Account level (present) vs User level (limited)
DB schema for MCL is solid
Requiring authentication to create or make changes to a login i.e., updating your email address on Amazon requires Face ID and submitting a 6-digit code from text message
We send invitations to users when they are added but not when they are first created
Should we limit the # of accounts that can be linked? System load times are slow for customers with 1K accounts linked
What would customers do that need to link more than the max allowed linked accounts?
Agents were not a persona that was considered when this was being built, and were tried to fit into
