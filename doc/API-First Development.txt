API-first development is an approach where APIs are designed and developed before any other part of the application.  The API is the primary interface for the application, ensuring it is well-designed, scalable, and secure.  Newly created APIs should be RESTful to promote wide use and consumption.  
OpenAPI
 should be used to define/describe RESTful APIs. 
Design First
:
APIs are designed early.  Ideally before any code is written. This involves defining the API endpoints, request/response formats, and other specifications using OpenAPI.
Consistency and Reusability
:
APIs are first-class citizens, ensuring they are consistent and reusable across different projects and teams
Collaboration
:
API design involves collaboration between developers, product managers, and other stakeholders to ensure the API meets the needs of all users
API contracts should be versioned, published, and kept up-to-date.
Mocking and Testing
:
Before implementation, APIs can be mocked and tested to validate their design and functionality.
