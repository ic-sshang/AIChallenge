[BILLER ENABLEMENT]
 Launch/enable a new biller account in SecureAuth
If a Tenant is required to be added in SecureAuth, what APIs are available to get this triggered through CRM?
What does this process look like?
Is it driven from the CRM?
Is it a trigger that happens on biller creation?  (for new billers)
Is it a button that’s pressed manually?  (for existing billers)
Where is this located?
What happens, what’s displayed after the process is completed?
[BILLER MGMT]
 Manage CIAM settings within CRM (Need a list of featured that we want to support and identify if we have the resources to support that)
What settings are available to update on the SA APIs?
Where do those sit in the CRM?  Products page?
[USER MGMT]
 Begin using SecureAuth (SA) for hosting user accounts
Feature toggle(s) in CRM to enable 3 different use-cases for CIAM
How do we do a one-time update of all users within a biller?
How are we storing the user passwords?  Encrypt vs hashed
If hashed, we’ll need a pw reset event
Once a biller is enabled on SA, we give them a new biller-specific login URL
Integration between IC (CRM/BP) with SA to create/edit/delete user accounts
 
[USER AUTH]
 Login page for authentication and password reset
Design element
Logic in existing login page to identify when to send user to SA login page
Support unique usernames within a biller
   
Integration between IC and SA for performing authentication (no MFA)
Need to support use case of user trying to log in on old URL
If username is in only one bid, give them a message to update their bookmark and send them to correct login page
If username is in multiple bids, there can only be one legacy biller that matches, so maybe we can handle it that way?  But what happens if they fail their login?
If we assume it’s a legacy user, …
[PLATFORM MGMT]
 Administering our instance of SecureAuth
What settings need to be reviewed and set?
What’s the process for keeping them updated?
Who owns this?  Is there an approval process?
How do they access the portal?
Who monitors the performance of the vendor?
Questions for SecureAuth
Is there a dev environment for us to work in?
What online docs should we be looking at?  (SecureAuth IdP ## or Identity Platform ## or 
CIAM
?)
What are workspaces vs identity pools?  Are there cost implications?
Confirm the APIs we have documented here for user managment: 
PRISM-577: Analyze and document the integration technique between IC(BP/CRM) and SecureAuth for Managing and Creating User Accounts
 
ListUsers API, does it return basic info?  Username, email, name, status, etc
What’s the difference between B2BUsers and Users?
Is there an API for retrieving a list of user history/logins?
What data/payload can be sent when updating user via 
https://docs.secureauth.com/ciam-apis/identity.html#tag/Users/operation/updateUser
 
What’s the relationship between Org and the Identity Pool?
The vanity URL that SecureAuth is going to provide to us, Product team will confirm on this after having a conversation with SecureAuth Reps.
What is the expectation from SecureAuth to identify the Organization?
Are there any APIs available for creating users under Workspaces? The docs only mention Pool-related endpoints.
When we tried obtaining an API token using the endpoint /default/admin/oauth2/token, we received a "resource not found" error. Could this be due to missing permissions or an incorrect configuration? Is there a different endpoint we should be using, considering this one is under the "admin" path?
How do we disable (not delete) an organization if we need to temporarily stop using SA for auth?
