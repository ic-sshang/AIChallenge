There are a number of different server environments in use at Invoice Cloud.  A host environment is simply defined as a server or collection of servers that host software applications.  At InvoiceCloud we have the production environment, staging environment (aka Test1), and many pre-production environments for development and quality engineering purposes.
While these pre-production environments serve different roles, they generally all connect to the same database instance and share similar configurations.
The goal of this document is to call attention to these environments and their configurations.  It shall also point out any deviations where they exist.
