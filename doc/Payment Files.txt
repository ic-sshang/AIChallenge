Payment files are critical for the Biller to reconcile the payments. This job runs both as an azure function and an automate/skybot job. The two most comment delivery methods for Payment export files are via Stratus or FTP.
How to figure out if the Biller uses Stratus. The easy way is to look up in the CRM
How to figure out if the Biller uses FTP / BillerFTPV2. 
The easy way is to look up in the FTP Management tab in the CRM.
If a biller has an export task in the FTP Export Processing tab they are part of the V2 process.
How to verify failures for the V2 Export Process.
Go to Microsoft Azure Portal and go to the exports application insights page by searching ICFTPExportProcessor.
Once at the Application Insights page for ICFTPExportProcessor, go to the Logs tab found on the left side, under the 
Monitoring
 section.
A window should pop up showing options for queries. Click on the 
X 
at the top right of the window.
In the text box for New Query 1, type in 
traces 
and
 
click Run to see traces for the last 24 hours. If the issue you are looking for happened at an earlier date, make sure to modify the time range. 
By Default, trace time data will be shown in UTC. Make sure to switch to Local Time to find traces more accurately.
If you’d like to show logs only relevant to only 1 function run of queuing exports, expand a relevant trace and right click the operation_Id. Click Include and Run the new Query.
Only relevant traces for that run should now appear
Payments get a WSReportID value when they are included on a payment export file or if the biller calls one of our report webservices.
If a payment does not have a WSReportID (or has a WSReportID  of 0), then that means it was not included in any payment report.
