This wasn’t originally on the commit list for Q1. This is a result of the left-over BT items (that we mentioned in the Q1 meeting). We identified the priority items that are related to finance reporting. There is currently a workaround, but that is manual. We were hoping to squeeze them in during Q1, however, we did not commit to completing these.

Identified risk associated with this epic; required additional testing and a slow roll out; We will engage the team to work on a plan for meeting the Q1 goal. This is going to help us to improve the CTP to be testable, reliable and maintainable.

 Next Quarter: Items Under Consideration
List out what the team proposes to do for next quarter, highlighting whether the item must be done next quarter (with a date if applicable), should be done, or could be done. Indicate a cut line of what you think makes it in, and your top 2-3 items out (or wherever you believe a controversial/thought-provoking line is).

  We have a lot of discovery to do and are hoping to have some small milestones identified that we can commit to for Q2. 
Must Do
Our expectation is that WT will own the discovery and delivery of the PayFac project and we will engage Wicked Pace as we can on areas that make sense. 
 Open Questions
Provide a list of any discussion questions the team has, especially if there are decisions/actions needed to unblock the next quarter’s roadmap.

We need to make a decision whether we will wait for Chase to be ready to manage our network tokenization or do we want to engage directly with the networks to continue discovery on Tokenization?

Account Validation - Discovery is nearly complete. We have added this to the backburner for now as we continue discovery on Commerce Center. Our plan is to add this to the backlog for now and consider this as a potential option for Wicked Pace once we confirm the best timing for this project to begin.
