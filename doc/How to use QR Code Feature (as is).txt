Tracking UTM tags in Pendo

Flow
Pull dataset from InvoiceCloud 
CloudReporting.BillerCustomerQRCodeReportDataSet API
 that contains all active customers/invoices for the provided InvoiceTypeID.  
This screenshot shows how you can pull this dataset using Postman. 
The dataset will have a row for every Customer.  Every Customer will have a Url value that is unique for that Customer.  
Generate a QR code for each of those URLs.  For demonstration purposes I have used a random QR code generator to generate the one below.  This can then be positioned in a location where the Customer can scan with their QR code reader.
After the QR code is read, the user will be taken to that URL in their browser.  Behind the scenes, our server receives that request and will respond with a “302 redirect” to redirect them to another URL.  This 2nd URL contains UTM tags.  Here is an example of one URL.  Note, it has 3 UTM tags (
utm_medium
, 
utm_source
, 
utm_campaign
).  These tag names are not customizable today.  The values for 
utm_medium
 and 
utm_source
 are fixed.  The value for 
utm_campaign
is unique per Biller.  The value format is 
invoice_QR_<billerid>
.  Product team may be the best resource to inquire about tracking these tags using Pendo.  
Here is a link to some documention on Pendo to set it up to track these values.
The User will land on the designated pay page.  In this example it automatically jumped them into Step 1 of the payment process but for others it may land on other pages based on their data.
