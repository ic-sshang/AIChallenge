Invoice Cloud registers billers with online banks to electronically deposit customer payments. OBD eliminates paper checks issued by online banking sites. 
Invoice Cloud matches electronic payments information with open invoices which greatly reduces the manual effort of matching customer names and bill amounts. Invoice Cloud provides an easy to use interface  to view partial matches.
The matches are “remembered” by OBD and matched automatically next time.
