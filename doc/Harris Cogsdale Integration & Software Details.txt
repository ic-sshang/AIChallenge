Biller Experience Guide
Product is supported, with the following limitations:
CloudPOSConnect is not supported for use with RemoteApp. RemoteApp is a specific type of RDP client. It is like RDP, but instead of logging into the box, and then using GP/CSM on the box, you are presented only with GP/CSM.
CloudPOSConnect is not compatible with Citrix
Cogsdale Pre-requisites: 
Minimum of GP 2013 and CSM 29.
.Net framework 4.6 or better.
Add-On Requests:
 
Once the Product is enabled in CRM, the biller needs to submit a Cogsdale Support Ticket and Cogsdale will send the external ftp link for software and documentation for CloudPOSConnect. If there are issues with the install, the Cogsdale support team will route the ticket appropriately
