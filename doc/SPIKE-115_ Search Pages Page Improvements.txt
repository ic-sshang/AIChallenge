Objective
The objective of this document is to outline the improvements to the invoice view functionality. It provides a high-level overview of the current implementation and introduces the proposed enhancements that will make the invoice view more user-friendly, modern, and aligned with best practices.
Current Implementation
User Interface Behavior
The invoice table currently includes:
VSOutputID
 as a static column (no hyperlink).
A 
View Invoice
 option under an unnamed column.
Invoice numbers
 may or may not be displayed depending on Virtual Site Output configuration. 
Technical Flow (High-Level) 
Links are built dynamically during the 
RowDataBound
 event.
If a 
custom URL
 is available, it is used. Otherwise:
For remote viewing, the invoice is opened via a URL with parameters replaced dynamically (e.g., InvoiceGUID, Custom fields).
For local viewing, the system redirects to 
InvoiceViewer.aspx
 with the relevant GUID and Biller information.
Code snippet: 
The final link always opens the invoice in a 
new browser tab
.
New Implementation
The new implementation introduces a modernized, more interactive approach to invoice viewing. The planned changes will require approximately 
4 sprints of effort
.
1. Invoice Number Availability & Actions Column
If 
InvoiceNumber
 is configured as a Virtual Site Output → display a 
Bill # column
 with hyperlinks.
If not configured → Bill # column shows neutral text, with a fallback 
View Invoice
 option under a new 
Actions column
.
The unnamed column will be replaced by a dedicated 
Actions column
 using a 
Kebab menu
 for options such as:
View Invoice
Set Reminder
Related Invoices
Technical Change: replace the existing data grid with 
datatable.net
 that will allow us to add hyperlink, custom button and Kebab menu.
Estimated Effort: 
1–2 sprints
.
New Implementation UI: 
💡 
Reference: Implementation similar to 
BillerEmailDomainManagement.aspx
 in Biller Portal.
2. Invoice Number → Modal Preview
Clicking a hyperlinked invoice number opens the invoice in a 
popup modal preview
 (instead of a new tab).
Technical Change: Create a reusable control 
ctrlModalPopup.ascx
 for modal functionality.
Estimated Effort: 
1 sprint
.
New Implementation UI:
💡 
Reference: Modal popup implementation in 
CustomEmailSetUp.aspx
 and 
BillerEmailDomainManagement.aspx
.
3. Modal Expansion & Download Options
From the modal, the user can 
expand to full screen
, which redirects to a new tab for a complete PDF view.
Options to 
download or save
 the invoice will be included.
Technical Change: Extend modal functionality to support expansion and download.
Estimated Effort: 
1 sprint
.
New Implementation UI:
Summary

Lacks modal preview, expansion, download, and accessibility improvements.
New State
Adds Bill # column with clickable invoice numbers.
Introduces a dedicated Actions column with multiple options.
Supports modal preview for inline invoice viewing.
Enables Expand and Download options inside modal.
Provides a more
