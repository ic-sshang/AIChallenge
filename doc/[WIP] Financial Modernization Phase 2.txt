Problem Alignment
The Problem
The pricing structure is inconsistent among different areas of the system such as the BOF, CRM, and biller statements. This causes confusion for our billers, and it costs time for Finance and Accounting to research and identify discrepancies between reports. 
Why: How do we know this is a real problem and worth solving?
Billers frequently contact us to dispute their bill and/or deposit amounts in their bank account. The Finance team is spending a lot of time researching and explaining pricing that should be straightforward with proper billing and reporting functionality.
Audience: Who are we building for?
We are building this for our billers and internal departments such as Finance, Accounting, and Sales.
High-level Approach
Success
How do we know if we’ve solved this problem?
Number of manually billed clients is <= 5
Pricing options on BOF match pricing options in CRM

Create pricing structures needed to support PSN pricing constructs
Kelton might have done some work on this, unsure.
This likely won’t come into play until later on in the process. Lower priority item for now.

4.1
Tiered Fees paid by Consumer (service fees)
* split into separate payer facing and biller facing items
Should be in scope considering PayPal migration? Or maybe Phase II when migrating to IC?
PSN provides payer facing tiered structure, but IC does not currently.

This is a high priority.
BOF does not currently support biller pricing (only service fees) at the invoice level.
Paypal work includes automation of the biller data during onboarding, so the BOF process must be updated to provide the appropriate data for selection.

Improve process of configuring pricing. Currently, the user must expand each Invoice Type for each Payment Type to view and change the pricing values.
John to meet with Carly, Donna, and possibly Mike to walk through the current paint points and areas of improvement.

Add MCC code to CRM for each invoice type
For each terminal – need data to populate. We currently have the ability to store it. Once we have the data from Chase, we can send to Kelton and team to populate
08/24/2020 - still waiting on data from Chase
2/25/2021 - Per Donna, we can capture this data at the Terminal level (MCC is tied to MID, not Invoice Type). This might not even be needed at this point.

We need sufficient invoice data, even if it must be manually exported from IC. Need more granular reporting. 
For example, recent Finmod work combined the IVR surcharge line item with the other Credit Card items. Another example is the percentage and flat rates being in the same column.

Capture pricing for all Sage billers and generate fee records
Currently there’s no pricing data for Sage billers.
Unsure if this is worth doing since the Sage billers will eventually be migrated to Braintree processor.

Capture pricing for all off-system processing, e.g., Bridgepay and generate fee records

Produce audit trail reporting for finance that is for the entire portfolio – one day behind
Will be the same structure as the one provided on the biller level
Unsure what this is. Carly said they receive a pricing/audit file each month. Having this daily would be overkill.

We should be able to have unlimited tier pricing for both Volume and Count.
Example:
Biller processes $500,000 EFT transactions. Those would be tiered by:
1-50k
51-100k 
(pricing goes down for higher tiers)
