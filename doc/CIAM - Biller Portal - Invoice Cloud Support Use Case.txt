Requirement: Organizational Hierarchy for Internal Customer Service Access
Context:
To support internal customer service users who need access to customer (biller) organizations within the CIAM platform, a hierarchical organizational model is required.
Requirement:
The system must support a 
parent-child organizational structure
 where:
A 
parent organization
 represents Invoice Cloud and contains an 
identity pool
 (either native or federated, e.g., Okta) for internal customer service users.
Each 
customer (biller) organization
 is modeled as a 
sub-organization
 under the parent and has its own 
separate identity pool
 for managing its users.
Rationale:
This structure enables internal customer service representatives to authenticate via our corporate identity provider and securely access customer (biller) organizations for support purposes, while maintaining strict separation of identity pools between internal and external users.
Implications:
The platform must support hierarchical relationships between organizations.
Role-based access controls (RBAC) must allow scoped access from the parent org into sub-orgs for authorized internal users.  The Biller Portal must understand this identity and its claims for any data management during the session.
Identity pools must be isolated per organization to ensure data privacy and security.
