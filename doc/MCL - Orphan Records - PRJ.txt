Identified Technical Problems
Orphaned records occur from unregistering an account tied to AutoPay and RSP
Temp logins create DB headaches – they can be manipulated without proper validation (i.e., tying a payment method to a temp login during registration that doesn’t belong to the user registering), and can lead to account takeovers
Invoice imports sometimes create empty logins or logins without proper ownership
Lack of consistency with how we create logins & temp logins across the platform
Unregistering a login might result in auto pay configurations pointing to payment methods that are no longer valid.
Look for uses of the below when unregistering, it works as expected
