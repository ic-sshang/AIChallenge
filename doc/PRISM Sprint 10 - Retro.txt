Better understanding of Coding Standards
Learnings from mistakes :)
complete the given story by the middle of the sprint, address all comments, and ensure the code is clean and follows good code review practices.
Most of the stories getting completed in last phase of sprint
Lack of proactiveness
The team should speak up if they encounter any blockers or are unsure about the approach they're working on or stuck with
Exhaustive story analysis
Focus on adding new shared code functionalities to C# projects rather than VB
Try to raise all PRs with internal review completed by the end of the first week, so we have enough time to address any code review comments and perform necessary refactoring.
Make sure to refactor the existing SQL calls to accommodate new standards
Buddy based learning and delivery.
Better focus and better support.
Ownership of blockers early.
To prevent late discovery of issues, ensure regression tests are run on the shared repositories immediately after development is completed.
Plan to complete all development and reviews within the first week of the sprint
Try to finish development work in first 3-4 days of sprint.
