 Retrospective
Collaborate together on what the team should Start doing, Stop doing, and Keep doing. The PM/Tech Lead/Designer should add items to the table below in advance of the meeting. We'll use these to talk about how we can improve our process going forward. 
Be sure you @ the owner of following through on each retrospective item.
Start doing
Stop doing
Keep doing
(SPARK) Improving internal code review process to save time
(Both) More reviews between both SPAM + SPARK of on-going work to see how we can better spread out work
(Both) Evaluate day/night platform activities to better align support & monitoring for more effective use of resources
(Both) FE dev knowledge sharing (Figma lunch & learn, Accessibility frame of mind)
(SPAM) Context switching
(SPAM) Carryover in sprints – predictability is still tough
(SPAM) More grooming & pre-grooming tasks – it caused more engagement from the rest of the team
Joint communication between SPAM + SPARK with standups to resolve/surface blockers
Quarterly capacity planning
(SPAM) Stay on top of Jira hygiene – keep comments flowing
(Both) Address single point of failure with SDET resourcing
