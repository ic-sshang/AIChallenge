Podman is another choice in tooling when working with containers. It largely maintains a 1:1 relationship with the Docker CLI in terms of the commands and options it utilizes. While largely a matter of personal preference, Podman provides a lot of benefits over the regular Docker CLI.
Benefits over Docker
It is free, open-source software. Docker requires licensing.
It is daemonless - meaning, unlike Docker, it can operate without a system-level service running in the background. i.e. Containers are run as a user account vs. running under a privileged service.
It is more secure, overall, than Docker. Containers are run in a rootless context - related to the daemonless nature of the tool.
More seamless integration with Kubernetes - 
podman generate kube
 can create Kubernetes manifest files for you, automatically. Podman can also run Kubernetes pods natively without additional tooling.
More modular - Docker is a large, monolithic tool - Podman is composed of several containerization tools under the hood that provide individual capabilities, and it is extensible as a result.
Downsides compared to Docker
There is no support for running Windows-based containers in Podman - though it can run in a Windows environment.
There is no native 
compose
 functionality - the community has produced a set of tools that create equivalency with Docker Compose.
Docker has much broader adoption - documentation & resources are more widely available for Docker at this point in time.
Installing Podman
Podman can be installed 
directly from the site
 - both a CLI and Desktop version are available. Podman Desktop provides equivalent container-management functionality to Docker Desktop and can manage containers that are built by either tool.
