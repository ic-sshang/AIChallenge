 October 2022
Invoice files are only used to upload a New Invoice and there is no way to adjust the balance of a previous invoice. 
Invoice Files are used to upload invoices and an adjustment file is used to keep the balance up to date. 
Make changes to the integration so the invoice number uses the Invoice Due Date and the integration is able to accept Adjustment files by splitting the file provided by SP.

Email address is currently not in the invoice file and will be added.
Modify the import of the txt file to include email address when file is split.
Email address is being added for all 1st ChoiceConnect billers and will be used by each biller as needed.
