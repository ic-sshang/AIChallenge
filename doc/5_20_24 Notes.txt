We are moving this document to confluence 
Historically there was a payer NPS survey that went out 
Team decided to nix it and we do not track anymore 
Nicole sends out quarterly research survey to payer (measures similar data) 
Discrepancies between payer and biller libraries 
Biller has/payer doesn’t: 
Stepper 
Tabs

Strategy to components library: 
Phase 1: Design one master component library for biller and payer (1.0) 
Phase 2: Develop master component library for 1.0 
There is concern over biller library not being responsive atm 
Phase 3: Be able to update UI for 2.0 through component updates
