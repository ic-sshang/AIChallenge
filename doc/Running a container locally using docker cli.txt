Build your docker image from a local docker file
Docker files designed to be used in Azure DevOps build pipelines will have arguments for NuGet credentials ( 
NUGET_USERNAME
 and 
NUGET_PAT
 ) and the build version (
SEMVER
).  If you do not have a NuGet PAT already you will need to create one,

powershell
docker build --file Dockerfile --build-arg NUGET_USERNAME=you@invoicecloud.com --build-arg NUGET_PAT=YOURPAT12345asdfej382jd892qr --build-arg SEMVER=1.0.0 --build-arg NUGET_VERSION=1.0.0 -t your-image-name .
Run your container locally from a docker image
your_conatiner_name
is the name you want to use for the container.  
your-image-name 
is the name of the image you created from your build.
If your application is a API or web application then your docker file will have HTTP traffic exposed on port 8080 per our standards.  You will need to map 8080 to one on your host. 
<port>
 is the placeholder.  Replace it with the desired value you want to use.
docker run -it -e ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development --rm -p <port>:8080 --name your_conatiner_name your-image-name
