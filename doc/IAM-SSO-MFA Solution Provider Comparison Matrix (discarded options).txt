Hidden Costs:
 Can include time spent on customization, integration, and staying up-to-date with security patches.
 
Developer Experience & SDKs
 
Standard Protocol Focus:
 Relies heavily on standard protocols like OpenID Connect and SAML. Integration often involves standard libraries for these protocols in your .NET application.  
Admin REST API:
 Offers a comprehensive REST API for programmatic administration and customization.  
Client Adapters:
 Provides client adapters for various platforms and languages, including .NET (though sometimes community-driven or requiring more manual configuration).  
Customization Flexibility:
 The open nature allows for deep customization but might require more in-depth knowledge.
Compatibility with .NET Web Applications
Keycloak provides a flexible, open-source option that integrates well with .NET through standard protocols but might require more hands-on configuration and potentially leveraging community libraries for a more streamlined experience.
 Its strength lies in its customizability.
