Payments
Used to post payments/ACH Rejects to instec API.
PUT
https://fwcprod.instecbilling.com/api
/payments/[DataPumpID]
(The datapump ID is used to make the api request on the instec side unique. This prevents double pumping.)

"Payments":[
{
"AccountNumber":{AccountNumber},
"name":{CustomerName},
"CheckNumber":{PaymentReference},
"InitialAmount":"{PaymentAmount}",
"InvoiceNumber":{InvoiceNumber},
"ExportId":{InvoiceNumber},

“OnlinePaymentFee“{ConvenienceFee},
(FrankCrumTEST only and if Declined Payment) 
"PolicyNumber":{InvoiceNumber (first part before the “-”)},
