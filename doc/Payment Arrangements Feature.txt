 Objective
Allow applicable payers to make arranged payments towards their invoice as set by the Biller.
Build support for Payment Arrangement amounts for applicable customers when making a payment via OTP, AutoPay, and IVR.
Note: The 
Arrangement Amount 
is set by the Biller and should not change. If it does, amount will be sent in the new BIF (e.g., if a penalty or fee is added).
 Requirements
User Interface
OTP
Saving the data and supporting Payment Arrangements in the OTP route aka “Quick Pay”
Display the ‘Arrangement Amount’ as a payment option in the One Time Payment route
IC checks to see if there’s an active pay arrangement, if so the most current arrangement amount will populate
Radio button option for the Payment Arrangement to be selected
NOTE:
 Eventually, we will offer this feature in AutoPay and IVR.
Database
We will create a new field as a standard DB field for storing the arrangement amount (e.g., PayArrangementAmount')
This will require that we:
Update the BIF table to include ‘ArrangementAmount’
Treat customers that do not have Payment Arrangements as NULL
:note:
atlassian-note
#EAE6FF
NOTE: Dependency on Data Services to make updates to the BIF
Data Validation
InvoiceCloud receives the data from an API via Invoice File
Payment amount is not going to change
When we call ‘Get Account’ they’ll have an indicator there that when TRUE we call ‘Get PayArrangementAmount’ to retrieve the amount
Integration will find a way to store it 
(that Product helps create)
CRM
Allow the ability to enable or disable Payment Arrangement feature
 Delivery Schedule
We will take a phased approach as we introduce this feature for (1) OTP, (2) AutoPay and (3) IVR sequentially.

Question
Answer
Date Answered
Is there a use case for Bellevue where multiple accounts that are paying with arrangements?
Yes: landlords. It’s possible to enroll in Payment Arrangements with multiple accounts. 
Follow-up question: how often does this happen/how many accounts in the past have been set up with Payment Arrangements for multiple accounts
 
Are there any legal requirements for setting up AutoPay for Arrangement Amounts? Does the user need to agree to a new set of terms/conditions?
If someone is already enrolled in AutoPay, is the user supposed to reconfirm with AutoPay for Payment Arrangement or should the system just 
know?
We are going to ask the biller to remove active AutoPay customers if enrolled when a customer becomes enrolled in Payment Arrangements.
 
Do we need an Arrangement exists flag to determine if a payer has Arrangements set up?
Discussed this possibility with Katie and it makes sense. Could be done after Phase 1. Need to think more on this.
 
Questions about CIS/Cayenta: 
DataPump into Cayenta: Does this have active PayArrange? That is what we will pull from the AP table.
Yes. Cayenta work is done.
 
What is the calculation logic? Does it need to be refactored?
What will the user experience be with the radio button?
