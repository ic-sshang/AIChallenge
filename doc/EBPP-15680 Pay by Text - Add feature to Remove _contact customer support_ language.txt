This document outlines the rationale for eliminating the 'contact customer support' language from the Pay by Text page. Additionally, it will describe the procedure for testing both the React implementation of the Pay By Text page and the MyIIS CustomerGroupPayByText.aspx page.

At A Glance:
At InvoiceCloud, two billers can share the same BillerID. For instance, Western National Mutual Insurance (BID: 4038) and Franklin Mutual Group (BID: 3658) each have multiple underwriting companies that use the same BillerID. Typically, InvoiceCloud supports only one biller per BillerID, which necessitates modifications for billers sharing a BillerID. An example of such a modification was on the Pay by Text page within the Customer Portal. Billers with several underwriting companies often have distinct Customer Support numbers for each company. The requirement was to either display the appropriate customer support number for the specific underwriting company or to omit the number entirely. Ultimately, the decision was made to remove the number.
Contact Customer Support text that was removed.

Repository Changes:
Two repositories had to be altered to remove the text from the Pay by Text page: MyIIS for the standard Pay by Text page and PayerPortal for the react version of the Pay by Text page. The text was simply deleted in both pages from both repositories. Note: the text had to be deleted twice for the REACT page since it was repeated twice: one for desktop and one for mobile. Because of this REACT pages must be tested in both desktop and mobile devices.

Testing Procedure:
Link to Test Doc
The testing procedure for this item was done on different browsers, mobile devices, iframe, and non iframe. It is best to utilize SauceLabs for these tests. To test the standard MyIIS page, make sure Biller option 139 is OFF when navigating to the Pay by Text page in the Customer portal. For reference, the web link should have a domain such as devtest5. To test iframe use the following Postman script to call an AgentConnect endpoint with AgentConnectViewMode set to 1.  Test iframe using this test iframe page.

Testing REACT pages:
The process for testing the REACT changes are the same as MyIIS except for two differences. One difference is that biller option 139 must be on to see the REACT changes. Next, there is currently no way to test the changes made to the REACT pages locally, so they must be deployed to devtest first. For reference, an easy way to ensure the REACT page is being displayed refer to the weblink
Here is how to deploy PayerPortal changes:
Select the Deployment pipeline
Select Run Pipeline 
Select branch and leave the Development instance set to Main - > select Run
Once the dev stage is in the waiting stage, provide approval and the branch will now be deployed across devtest.
