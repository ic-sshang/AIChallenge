Overview
ICEmailQueueController (EQC) runs in Azure batch. For testing, it uses the 
icbatchtest
 batch account. For production, it uses the 
icautopay
 batch account. It runs in the 
ControllerPool
 of each account. In each batch account, the job schedule 
ICEmailQueueController
 is used to start and configure the job run. Once the controller batch job starts, it will create separate batch jobs in the accounts/pools below. These separate batch jobs will have a task for each biller that runs EmailQueueProcessing for 1st/2nd/3rd notifications.

Choose a demo biller and ensure the “send demo emails” flag is set via “Portal Customization” → “Testing Options” (once it’s enabled, it can be set for up to a week). Next, upload a BIF with the 
FirstNotifyRequestedDate
 set to 10 days from today's date. Then, register the customer. Then set the job schedule to the next available time (usually 8 minutes from the current time) with the following environment variables: 
rerun = 1
 and 
billeridlist=2401
 (or whichever bid is used).
