Current Setup
See 
1.5 Payer Portal - 15PP
 for visualization and documentation of current setup.
Basically with the current setup, all of the React pages are handled via 
redirects
.
The page redirects to a different URL path “
portal/UI
” instead of “
portal/
“
Eventually, with each page moved over to React we would decommission all of the redirecting and redo the authentication structure so we’re not piggybacking off of the MyIIS session anymore.
This repo would at that point become the official/primary payer or biller repo.
Martin suggests importing the new design-system repository as a federated module where it’s dynamically imported so we can 
avoid having to rebuild every other repository when we make a change to a button.
Action Items:
Invite Martin to the next developer meeting we have on the design system.
Martin is interested in helping us in general and also helping us decide what pages to start designing in React first – very interested in helping make those priority calls.
Martin was a little concerned with the UI being jarringly different between React and non-React pages. Something to be conscious of.
Research whether we can use the advantages of the new React19 compiler alongside the federated module setup (we should be able to though 
 )
Also look into Nextjs’ routing compatibility
Module Federation - Quick Rundown
Module Federation is a new feature introduced in Webpack 5, but its history dates back to 2017. At that time, the Webpack team began exploring a way to share code between multiple applications.
https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/
 
Module Federation is an architectural pattern for the decentralization of JavaScript applications (similar to 
micro services
 on the server-side).
It allows you to share code and resources among multiple JavaScript applications (or 
micro-frontends
). This can help you:
Reduce code duplication
Improve code maintainability
Lower the overall size of your applications
Enhance the performance of your applications
Module Federation is suitable for the following scenarios:
Large Applications
: For large applications, you can break the application into multiple micro-frontends and use Module Federation to share code and resources between them.
Microfrontend Architecture
: Module Federation is an ideal tool for building microfrontend architectures.
Multi-team Development
: Module Federation can assist multiple teams in collaboratively developing large applications.
 
Use cases
https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/#components-library-as-container
 
 
Components library as container 
 
Many applications share a common components library which could be built as a container (separate build) with each component exposed. Each application consumes components from the components library container. Changes to the components library can be 
separately deployed without the need to re-deploy all applications
. *The application automatically uses the up-to-date version of the components library.
