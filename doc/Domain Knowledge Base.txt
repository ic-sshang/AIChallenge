These embedded engineers would work together in order to develop common processes, tools and share knowledge.  This will also help to reduce significant duplication of effort and bring in standard best practices for the entire enterprise. 
For this chosen approach to succeed the product scrum teams should commit themselves to Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) to ensure high-quality customer experiences by clearly articulating the operational characteristics of the system in addition to the business characteristics. Business characteristics include the process flow, business rules that govern the decision, and the data element that are required and must be stored. The operational characteristics include the reliability and security of the service. The typical Non-Functional Requirements cover security, performance, recoverability, cost, reliability, consistency, scalability, and flexibility. The Service Reliability Engineers would be the champions to influence and support the NFRs as part of the embedded culture. 
Scope of eSRE
The SRE's scope is to improve observability which is the primary focus at this point in time.  our focus areas are observability, incident response, and alert reduction.	
Observability
Bring application and critical services under APM and transactions
Incident Response 
During the incident  - eSRE will be on the call to assist and help with the research and mitigation activity
Post-incident activity - Implement work items identified by the Product teams as part of the RCA process that improves detection and mitigation.
Alert Reduction
Be First Responders for Alerts during 
normal business hours ie 8:00 AM CT to 5:00 PM CT
Work on reducing the Alerts and making them actionable wherever possible
Work on improving signal to noise (SNR) ratio
