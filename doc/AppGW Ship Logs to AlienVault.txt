Summary
Per conversation with 
 , 
 , and 
 , the App Gateway Access Logs need to be shipped to AlienVault for PCI Compliance.  There is an existing Event Hub 
alienvault (DevOpsEventHub/alienvault)
 that the Alien Vault sensor uses for ingesting Logs from other places that must be used due to the AlienVault constraint that it can only configure consuming messages from a single Event Hub.  AlienVault does have an App Gateway predefined “Application” that will enable easy digestion, analysis, correlation, and enrichment of the App Gateway Access Logs that 
 will configure once Events start streaming into the Event Hub.
