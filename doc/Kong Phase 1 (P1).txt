Phase 1 will be the introduction to Kong into the ecosystem.
Goals
TLS for all proxied traffic (.invocecloud.com)
Routing and pass-through for new RESTful APIs hosted on 
api.invoicecloud.com
Routing and pass-through for qualified (roll out program) existing APIs hosted on www.invoicecloud.com
Sending tracing data of all proxied communications to New Relic (global zipkin plugin)
Configure New Relic for observability/monitoring and alerting 
Establish configuration (Dinesh / SRE input) dashboards, charts, alerts etc..
Using Kong Manager to review routing and plugin configurations
Using YAML in ADO pipelines to configure Kong routes and plugins
Using the Developer Portal to provide/publish API documentation
Establish API documentation standard (Open API) and API suites
Using YAML in ADO pipelines to handle blue / green deployments of proxied backends, ring balancer
Using Kong Manager to temporarily re-route proxied backends, ring balancer
Proposal 1
Kong is used for APIs and a upstream component is used to manage what traffic is sent to Kong (roll out to Kong can be scoped to target applications using path based routing)
Proposal 2
 Kong is used for all HTTP traffic on a given domain (roll out to Kong is scoped at a domain level)
