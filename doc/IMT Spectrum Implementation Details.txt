Test Portals
IC Hosted Test Portal: 2548 - IMT Spectrum Test
Partner Hosted Test Portal: IMT Spectrum has an environment connected to the IC BID 2548
Billers will not have their own test portal in IC during implementation. Billers will use one portal for UAT and transition that same portal to PROD.

Required Options
No known required CRM options for the integration.
IMT Billers refer to the ‘account number’ as the policy number. Updates should be made in all places to change ‘account’ to ‘policy’.
Questionnaire items to review:
Allow Partial Payments: Set to no/off in BIF - confirm with biller
Email Address: Talk with billers about capturing email address for accounts. If it’s not something they’re doing today, suggest capturing it going forward so IMT can send it to IC for us to send notifications (already a field in the BIF)
If any of these items need to change, please submit a case to 
solutionsengineer@invoicecloud.com
