Identified Technical Problems
Improper Account Linking happens. Downstream impacts of Account Linking that Billers/Payers are unaware of. When issues arise for accidental or improper linking/unlinking, manual work is required to link/relink/unlink
Account linking behaviors are inconsistent across software components
Different APIs (REST, SOAP, SAML, Agent Connect, etc.) each apply different business rules for login creation and linking
Custom jobs and RTDR-based linking are still in use creating multiple variations in behavior across integrations
Lack of documentation and defined behaviors for account linking/unlinking that the business should follow
Removing a login can unintentionally break links or associations with customer accounts -- can result in unclear ownership of payment methods
