Payment Export File
File Summary/Purpose: The purpose of this file is to transfer payment data from IC to the biller
File Extension: .txt
Current Filetypes and export filenames for 2 used in production below
File Naming Convention for File Type ID 239 (
IF_NHP CloudStore LockBox
): NHP_ICLockboxCloudStore_{YYYYMMDD.txt}
File Naming Convention for File Type ID 478 (
IF_NHP Payment Export - Settled Only
): NHP_ICLockbox_{YYYYMMDD.txt}
File Types and Logic for 4 file types and payment export files (2 modified, and 2 newly created in August 2025)
FileType
Logic
Payment Export Filename
IF_NHP CloudStore LockBox
Payment export file will EXCLUDE AMEX payments
NHP_ICLockboxCloudStore_{YYYYMMDD.txt}
IF_NHP CloudStore Lockbox AMEX
Payment export file will only contain AMEX payments
NHP_
ICLockboxCloudStore
_AMEX_{YYYYMMDD.txt}
IF_NHP Payment Export - Settled Only
Payment export file will exclude settled AMEX payments
NHP_ICLockbox_{YYYYMMDD.txt}
IF_NHP Payment Export - Settled Only AMEX
Payment export file will only contain settled AMEX payments
NHP_ICLockbox_AMEX_{YYYYMMDD.txt}
Because AMEX funding usually occurs the day before all other payment types, each File Type has logic to create 2 payment files:
Payment file one for each file type will contain AMEX PAYMENTS ONLY
Payment file two for each file type will contain ALL OTHER Payment types
SUMMARY:
Total of 4 payment export files (two that exclude AMEX, and two that contain ONLY AMEX)
File Delimiter: fixed-width
