The Azure Key Vault provider for the Secrets Store CSI Driver allows Kubernetes pods to securely access secrets, keys, and certificates stored in Azure Key Vault. This integration is achieved through a CSI volume, which mounts the secrets directly into the pod's filesystem.  This method ensures that sensitive information is managed securely and efficiently.
The Azure Key Vault CSI Driver is installed on all application clusters.
