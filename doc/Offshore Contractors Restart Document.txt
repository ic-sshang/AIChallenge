Managing Azure VMs
First always notify the engineering-maintenance channel in slack prior to restarting the VM. Give at least 15 minutes for Users to give any objections. 
Try to restart via the servers directly first if possible, using RDP.
If RDP is not available log into 
Portal.azure.com
 
Navigate to Virtual Machines
you should only see two machines available Contractorterm1(10.0.25.4) and contractorterm2(10.0.25.5)
select the term you would like to restart by the check box next to it. This will unlock the restart buttom that is greyed out at the top bar.
