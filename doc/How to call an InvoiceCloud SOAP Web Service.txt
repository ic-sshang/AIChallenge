This document describes how to call one of the many InvoiceCloud SOAP web services.  Because each service has differing required criteria this won’t work for every service but the process should be about the same.  We will call this web service using Postman.
Locate a SOAP Web Service you would like to call.  For this example we want to call the InvoiceCloud CloudReporting web service
https://www.invoicecloud.com/portal/webservices/cloudreporting.asmx
 
The page will list the supported web methods on that web service.  For this example we will use the BillerCustomerQRCodeReportDataSet web method.  Click on that link.  It will take you to this page.
https://www.invoicecloud.com/portal/webservices/cloudreporting.asmx?op=BillerCustomerQRCodeReportDataSet
This page describes how to communicate with this web method.  For simplicity we will use the 
HTTP POST 
option listed towards the bottom of the page.
Open up Postman
We will want to update the Postman tab to have the settings that the page from earlier described.  Start with setting the 
Body 
tab.
Set the HTTP Method to be POST
Using the HTTP POST screenshot from earlier as a reference, set the URL to be a concatenation of the value for 
Host
 and the partial url listed on the first line.  For this example it comes out to 
https://www.invoicecloud.com/portal/webservices/cloudreporting.asmx/BillerCustomerQRCodeReportDataSet
On the Body tab, click on the 
raw
 button and paste the last line listed on the screenshot from earlier.  In this example this value is 
BillerGUID=string&WebServiceKey=string&InvoiceTypeID=string&LookBackDays=string
You will need to replace the highlighted values below with the actual values.  For this example this screenshot will not display the values used.  Use your own values.
We now want to set the Headers tab.  Postman will help by filling out most of the headers you need but for our example we will need to make 1 change.  
Uncheck the Content-Type checkbox
Add a new Key and set it to Content-Type
Set the value of that Content-Type to the value listed on the screenshot from earlier.  In our case it is 
application/x-www-form-urlencoded
This request is now ready to post to the InvoiceCloud web service to get a response.  Click on the Send button.  If everything was configured properly you will get a response in the bottom half of the tab.  In our example we received back exactly what the screenshot from earlier told us we would get.
