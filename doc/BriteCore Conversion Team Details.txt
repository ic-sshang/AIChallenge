Summary
A BriteCore Conversion refers to the transition of an existing client from the IMT or Town & Country system to a BriteCore CIS platform, requiring a full re-implementation. These projects follow a “roll-over” style approach, resembling a new BID implementation but without components like training and data conversions.
 
Process
Definitions
·        API Key: A unique identifier used to authenticate requests between systems.
·        BillerGUID: A globally unique identifier assigned to each biller in the Invoice Cloud system.
·        Data Pump: A service that transmits payment and registration data between systems.
·        IVR: Interactive Voice Response system used for phone-based payment interactions.
·        SFTP: Secure File Transfer Protocol used for exchanging files between systems.
Key Responsibilities
·        Biller: Provides legacy system details and participates in testing and validation.
·        Invoice Cloud Project Manager: Coordinates the integration process and confirms the maintenance window.
·        BriteCore Implementation Team: Supplies API endpoints and supports configuration and testing.
Quality Assurance
·        Invoice Cloud QA: Validates data flow and confirms successful integration in staging.
Roles
Biller: The organization being integrated into the BriteCore platform.
Invoice Cloud Project Manager: Oversees the integration project and coordinates with stakeholders.
Provider: BriteCore, responsible for supplying technical integration support.
Procedure
BriteCore 
notifies the Senior 
Project Manager
 that an existing IC biller has been sold.
The 
biller
 opens a new Salesforce Biller Support Case to initiate the process.
This will initiate a task for Invoice Cloud Sales teams to approach the biller with conversion paperwork.
Once the paperwork is completed, the conversion is reviewed by Invoice Cloud’s Intake meeting team and assigned to Boarding & an 
FS Implementation Project Manager.

The assigned 
Project Manager
 prepares the project schedule and conducts a kickoff meeting with the biller and BriteCore.
For 
Existing Billers
BriteCore
 provides the necessary endpoints.
Questionnaires are completed, using the original BIF customizations as a reference.
Collect the “Base URL” and “API Key” from BriteCore, SFTP Setup, and API Key
The coding sheet is finalized and filed.
The IVR Questionnaire is completed in collaboration with the biller.
Using the CRM, the IC implementations project manager also generates the SFTP credentials to provide to Mohammad along with the BillerGUID, IC API Key, and Webservice Key:
Coding is completed, and test files are loaded into the system.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is conducted and presented to the biller.
The biller signs off on the new implementation.
10.  The new environment is launched and set live.
11.  The assigned Project Manager opens a Salesforce case to request switching Support Central logins to BriteCore users.
12.  The Project Manager formally closes the project.
Out of Scope
·        Training: Not required, as the IC biller and customer experience remain unchanged.
·        Conversions (Handled by FM PM): In roll-over style conversions, AutoPay and Paperless users must re-enroll upon policy binding or renewal.
·        Marketing: Managed entirely by the biller. Invoice Cloud does not provide marketing support. Logos are transferred from the old BID to the new one.
