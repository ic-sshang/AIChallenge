Reusing previous version of newrelic/newrelic from the dependency lock file
Using previously-installed newrelic/newrelic v3.7.0
Terraform has been successfully initialized!
You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.
If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

PS C:\Users\DSubramani\terraform-projects> terraform plan
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the
following symbols:
create
Terraform will perform the following actions:
newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created
resource "newrelic_alert_policy" "golden_signal_policy" {
account_id          = (known after apply)
id                  = (known after apply)
incident_preference = "PER_POLICY"
name                = "Golden Signals - DataPump"
}
Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if
you run "terraform apply" now.
PS C:\Users\DSubramani\terraform-projects> terraform apply
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.
  Enter a value: yes
newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating...
newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 0s [id=3716256]
