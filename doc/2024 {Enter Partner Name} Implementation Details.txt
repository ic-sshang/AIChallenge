No more payments or adjustments should be allowed on that closed Invoice.

Payment Codes 
Some integrations allow billers to specify payment codes (mapped to IC payment sources). Generally will apply to legacy integrations. New integrations are built out with standard codes.
example: Request payment code mapping from biller for IC configuration.

Some integrations are configured to a code/value in RTDR to block CC and/or ACH that’s configured by the biller (changes with each biller project). Input details if that applies to the integration. Generally will apply to legacy integrations. New integrations are built out with standard values.
example: Biller configures block CC flag and will need to provide the ‘alert code’ to IC for configuration.
Block ACH Flag 
Some integrations are configured to a code/value in RTDR to block CC and/or ACH that’s configured by the biller (changes with each biller project). Input details if that applies to the integration. Generally will apply to legacy integrations. New integrations are built out with standard values.
