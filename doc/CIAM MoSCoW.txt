 Must Haves
SSO Integration for External IDPs
Ability to configure external Identity Providers (IDPs) for billers who wish to use their existing Single Sign-On (SSO) to access the Biller Portal.
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Support
Option for billers (without their own IDP) to enable MFA, with configurable factors such as:
Password
Authenticator App
Email-based One-Time Password (OTP)
Passkey
MFA preferences should be configurable at the organization level.
SSO via Our IDP
Support for billers without their own IDP to authenticate via our Identity Provider using SSO.
Custom Sign-In Page
 for the SSO-MFA for Biller Portal
Allow IC-specific branding
Allow configurable elements such as different ID fields, MFA factors, and messaging
Provisioning of user accounts and details into our IDP for their access to the Biller Portal through our IDP or their IDP SSO/MFA.
Managing the Password policy through our IDP within the scope of PCI compliance.
Self-Service Security Management through Biller Portal
 for managing the Password.
Delegated User Management: 
Enable billers to manage user creation and administration via the Biller Portal.
Support Single Log Out. 
In case the Biller Portal is integrated with the Billers’ IDP, signing out from the Biller Portal should also singout for their IDP and Signing out from their IDP should also sign out for Biller Portal.
For the Billers with IDP: Tightly integrated with their HR system, so when employees are terminated, their access is immediately killed.
Should always have a backdoor user/pass (admin) that can bypass the SSO in case the provider is down
