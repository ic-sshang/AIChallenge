How to Use Postman to Send a POST Request with JSON Data
Postman is a powerful tool for testing APIs. It allows developers to send requests, inspect responses, and debug APIs with ease. In this guide, we’ll walk through how to send a 
POST
 request using Postman with a sample JSON payload to the 
InvoiceCloud API
.
Scenario Overview
We want to send a POST request to the following endpoint:
https://www.invoicecloud.com/cloudpaymentsapi/v2

With 
Basic Authentication
 
and the following JSON body:
{
  "CreateCustomerRecord": true,
  "Customers": [
    {
      "AccountNumber": "ACCAPI0000001",
      "Name": "TEST BUSINESS",
      "Address": "123 Elm Street",
      "City": "Hewitt",

      "Zip": "76643",
      "EmailAddress": "john.doe@test.com",

          "TypeID": 1,
          "DueDate": "2030-10-17",

    }
  ],
