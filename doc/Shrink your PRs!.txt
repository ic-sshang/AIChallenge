Guidelines for Managing Pull Request (PR) Sizes
Objective:
 
To reduce the size of pull requests, making them more manageable and easier to review, thereby improving code quality and reducing the risk of errors slipping through due to reviewer fatigue.
1. Understanding PR Size and Its Impact
Large PRs
 often arise from big stories or epics and can be overwhelming to review. They can lead to reviewer fatigue, increase the risk of errors being missed, and complicate the merge process.
Small PRs
 are more focused and easier to review, test, and merge. They allow for quicker feedback and reduce the likelihood of merge conflicts and regressions.
2. Defining a Small PR
A 
small PR
 is a concise set of changes focused on a single feature, bug fix, or improvement. It should ideally be a testable unit of work that can be reviewed independently of other changes.
3. Strategies for Shrinking PRs
Break Down User Stories:
 Encourage breaking down large user stories into smaller, manageable tasks that each result in a separate PR.
Example:
 Instead of one PR for a comprehensive feature update (e.g., updating API calls to calculate a service fee), break it into multiple PRs: one for the business logic, another for UI updates, and another for model changes.
Create Feature Branches for Larger Changes:
 For features that span multiple stories or require extensive changes:
Use feature branches to accumulate smaller PRs. This allows each small PR to be reviewed and tested independently, even if the full feature is released together later.
Remember:
 While feature branches are commonly used, be mindful that long-lived feature branches can lead to integration issues and regressions if not properly managed. 
Use Sub-tasks or Sub-stories:
 When breaking down stories, ensure there is logical division and context for reviewers.
Create sub-tasks or sub-stories in your issue tracker to align with each PR. This makes it easier for reviewers to understand the scope and context of changes.
4. Responsibilities of the Engineering Team
Push Back on Large Stories:
 If product creates large stories, it's the engineering team's responsibility to negotiate breaking them down further.
Remember
: Product owners typically do not concern themselves with the number of PRs; they care about the outcome. It's up to engineers to advocate for manageable work units.
Be Proactive in Planning:
 During sprint planning or backlog grooming, identify stories that are too large and break them down early.
This proactive approach prevents large PRs from being created in the first place.
5. Best Practices and Coaching
Educate and Coach:
 Regularly discuss best practices for creating small PRs and breaking down work in sprint planning sessions or team meetings.
Review Past Examples:
 Use examples from past PRs to demonstrate the benefits of smaller, more focused changes.
