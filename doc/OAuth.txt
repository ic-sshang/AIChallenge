OAuth 2.0 is a widely adopted authorization framework that offers several key benefits for securing access to resources. Here are some reasons why you might choose to use OAuth 2.0:
1. 
Enhanced Security
OAuth 2.0 allows users to grant third-party applications limited access to their resources without sharing their credentials. This reduces the risk of credential theft and misuse.
2. 
User Control
Users have granular control over what data they share and with whom. They can specify the scope of access, such as read-only or read-write permissions, and revoke access at any time.
3. 
Flexibility
OAuth 2.0 supports various types of applications, including web apps, mobile apps, and desktop apps. It can handle different types of clients and use cases, making it highly versatile.
4. 
Scalability
The framework is designed to work with large-scale systems and can handle numerous clients and resource servers. This makes it suitable for enterprise-level applications and services.
5. 
Interoperability
OAuth 2.0 is an open standard, meaning it can be implemented across different platforms and technologies. This interoperability is crucial for integrating diverse systems and services.
6. 
Token-Based Authentication
OAuth 2.0 uses access tokens to grant permissions. These tokens can be short-lived and refreshed, enhancing security by limiting the window of opportunity for misuse.
Use Case
Today we are implementing the Client Credential grants for our APIs to allow Billers to access their own data.  This will supersede Basic Auth to provide better access control.
