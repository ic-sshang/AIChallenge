Below are a list of challenges/opportunities that presented themselves during the onboarding process.
Opportunity 
Description
How long did it take to overcome?
Time lost
Suggestion
Jira
Needed permissions to be able to get assigned tasks
Maybe a day
Azure
Was hitting a 401 when trying to access Azure
1-2 weeks +
Remote desktop for Mac
Needed app added to self-service
A day
Biller shard added to test DB & devtest CRM login creation
Needed our own devtest CRM login, etc.
At least a month
Maybe have this set up in advance
Training Videos
Definitely a helpful primer, but felt like we really started learning once we got onto team SPAM, started interacting with team members and doing hands on work. Was harder to keep product knowledge cemented via the video training period without having real tasks to carry out, so there was a bit of re-learning once we started on tickets.
Didn’t know that some of the quizzes were no longer completable due to CRM permissions either, but was able to just skip past that.
A few weeks
Automated testing
Didn’t know that we needed to pull down the testing repos to run the automated tests (test-customer-portal, test-virtual-site, util-qe-framework)
May have extended a release night call due to missing an element
A brief overview/walkthrough of the process and expectations. (I believe a more in depth lunch and learn is coming soon)
