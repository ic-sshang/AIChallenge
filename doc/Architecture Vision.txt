API First Approach ( 
API-First Development
 )
Design APIs Before Implementation
: Start by designing APIs using tools like Swagger/OpenAPI  
https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html
 . This ensures that APIs are well-documented and agreed upon before any code is written.
Contract-Driven Development
: Use API contracts to drive development, ensuring that all teams understand the API specifications and can work independently.
Event Driven Workloads ( 
Event Driven Workloads
 )
Event Generation:
 External systems generate events as messages in Azure Service Bus.
Event Detection
: KEDA monitors Azure Service Bus for new events/messages.
Scaling Decision
: Based on the number of pending events/messages KEDA decides whether to scale the application up or down.
Autoscaling
: KEDA interacts with the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to adjust the number of PODs/application instances.
Event Processing
: The scaled .NET 8 console job application process the events/messages and performs the necessary actions.
Microservices Architecture (
Microservices
 )
Decompose Monoliths
: Break down monolithic applications into smaller, independent microservices. Each microservice should have a single responsibility and be loosely coupled.
Domain-Driven Design
: Use domain-driven design principles to identify and define the boundaries of microservices.
RESTful Principles ( 
REST API Design
 )
Statelessness
: Ensure that each API request from a client contains all the information the server needs to fulfill that request.
Resource-Based
: Design APIs around resources (e.g., payments, invoices) and use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on these resources.
.NET 8
Leverage .NET 8 Features
: Utilize the latest features and improvements in .NET 8 for building applications, taking advantage of its performance, security, and cross-platform capabilities.
ASP.Net Core
: Use ASP.Net  Core for building RESTful APIs.
.Net
: Use .Net Core for building Console jobs to handle event driven workloads and scheduled driven workloads. 
Kubernetes for Orchestration
Containerization
: Package each API or Job as a Docker container to ensure consistency across different environments.
Kubernetes Deployment
: Use Kubernetes to manage and orchestrate containerized workloads. This includes handling scaling, load balancing, and failover.
KEDA: 
Use KEDA k8s horizontal pod autoscaler to trigger event driven workloads.
Kong API Gateway
API Lifecycle Management
: Use Kong API Gateway to manage the entire lifecycle of APIs, including versioning, deprecation, and retirement.
Security
: Implement authentication, authorization, and rate limiting using Kong's built-in plugins.
OAuth 2.0 (external integrators)
JWT (internal applications)
Traffic Control
: Use Kong to handle load balancing, request/response transformations, and traffic routing.
Monitoring and Analytics
: Leverage Kong's integration using OTEL to gain insights into API usage and performance.  OTEL data can be forwarded to New Relic.
API Documentation
Automated Documentation
: Use Kong's support for Swagger/OpenAPI 
https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html
 to manage API documentation in the Developer Portal.
Developer Portal
: Set up a developer portal using Kong's Dev Portal feature to provide account registration, documentation, tutorials, and support for developers.
Security and Monitoring
API Gateway
: Implement Kong API gateway to handle cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and logging.
Monitoring and Logging
: Use OTEL support and New Relic for monitoring, logging, and analyzing application usage and performance.
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
Automated Pipelines
: Set up CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
Testing
: Implement automated testing (unit, integration, and end-to-end) to ensure the reliability and stability of APIs.
Unit Test - Build
Integration and End To End - Post Deployment Triggered, Independently Runnable 
Documentation and Developer Experience
Comprehensive Documentation
: Provide detailed API documentation using Swagger/Open API 
https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html
 to help developers understand and use APIs effectively.
Developer Portal
: Create a developer portal in Kong to offer registration, resources, tutorials, and support for developers integrating with APIs.
