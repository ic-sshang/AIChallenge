Architecture & Implementation Update:
The 
technical discovery phase
 took longer than anticipated.
The 
initial proposed architecture
 underwent several revisions following multiple discussions and feedback from the 
Architecture team
.
We are currently in the process of securing 
approvals for multiple applications and repositories
 from the 
Platform team
.
Due to these dependencies, we are expecting a 
delay extending into mid-Q4
