Problem Alignment
We currently have no way for payment methods to be verified by an owner. In our existing workflows the first user to login to an account that has a stored payment method is then considered the owner of that payment method. We obfuscate the full payment details however we are not verifying that the user knows the obfuscated information and should have access.

Billers
Multi-user billers mostly are our concern where there is a higher risk that someone other than the payment method holder could get the payment info. However this payment verification solution will still work for non-multi-user accounts too.

Key Features
Authenticated flow 
The goal of this flow is to have the person registering for an account for the first time be alerted that there is a saved payment method on that account that needs verification. As part of the onboarding flow we would want to encourage the user first to verify the payment method so they can do other things in the account, like register for AutoPay. Below is the high level use case of a user verifying their payment method. 
Other use cases we need to consider:
If the second payer registers on the account and all payment methods have been verified. 
If the payer goes to the AutoPay page and tries to use a saved payment method.
In the one time payment route with saved payment method do we do the verification then?
Unauthenticated flow
We will have the account number and possibly email. If there is a save payment method on the account we can ask the payer to verify the payment method before signing in.
