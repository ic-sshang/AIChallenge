Random Thoughts/Music Request
We have completed the Log4Net tickets
We were able to generate bulk tickets
We started the Newtonsoft tickets
We started to try sub-tasks methods
Some stories got issues during prod deployment
We don't have access to classic pipeline
We need access to other repos quicker like ICPaymentProcessingAPI we got access till the end of the day
Shout out  to Mauricio for taking the initiative to automate  the Jira story creation  for a huge number of repos.
