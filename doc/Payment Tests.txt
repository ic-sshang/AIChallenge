Debit and Credit Authorization and Payment Test Form
Invoice Cloud requires that the Biller’s bank allows IC and our payment vendors to credit and/or debit the account in order to deposit payments, Credit Card chargebacks, ACH/EFT returns, or credits issued to customers from within the IC platform. The Company IDs (COIDs) must be allowed to credit and debit accounts and a copy of this Authorization must be saved to the Box before requesting a Payment Test.
