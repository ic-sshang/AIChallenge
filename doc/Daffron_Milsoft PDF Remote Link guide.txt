Overview
Daffon/Milsoft  works by making a single service call to the printer. The url in Advanced Setting 20 is used with the parameters ‘PROCESSING_TYPE’, ‘ACCOUNT_NUMBER’, and ‘SUB’. Depending on the Remote PDF Service Version used in Advanced Setting 119, ‘BCTR’, ‘LDMO’ and ‘PRINT_FORM’ may also be sent. Mappings of these values as well as the available Remote PDF Service Versions can be found here:
