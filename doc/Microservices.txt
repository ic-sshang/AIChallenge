Microservice architecture structures an application as a collection of small, loosely coupled, and independently deployable services.  Each service is designed to handle a specific business function and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
Characteristics:
Loosely Coupled
:
Services are independent of each other, allowing changes to be made to one service without affecting others
Fine-Grained
:
Each service is small and focused on a single business function
Independent Deployment
:
Services can be deployed independently, enabling continuous delivery and deployment
Technology Agnostic
:
Services can be built using different programming languages, databases, and other technologies
Lightweight Communication
:
Services communicate through lightweight protocols, often HTTP/REST or messaging queues
Decentralized Data Management
:
Each service manages its own database, promoting data autonomy and reducing dependencies
