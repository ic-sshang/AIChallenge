We’re halfway through the year, and I wanted to take a moment to highlight the incredible progress our team has made on our journey from a traditional support function into a true SRE partner. This transformation is more than a shift in structure; it’s a shift in mindset, capability, and business value. We’re no longer just delivering tasks, we’re delivering 
outcomes. 
Outcomes that directly improve product reliability, customer experience, and operational resilience.
Key Outcomes Delivered
 
Bug Resolution Embedded With Product Teams
This year alone, our team has resolved 
28 product bugs 
(up from 0 last year). This is a powerful marker of how we’ve evolved from escalation managers to active contributors in product health. These fixes have directly improved stability and prevented recurring issues, helping reduce reactive support.
Proactive Triage With an AI Agent
We've developed an AI agent that 
asks context-aware follow-up questions
 during ticket triage. This helps accelerate root cause analysis and reduce cognitive load on engineers by driving the right questions based on our internal knowledge base.
Automation and Toil Reduction
We’ve built a suite of internal automation scripts that streamline repetitive tasks, improving our mean time to resolution (MTTR) and freeing up engineering bandwidth for higher-value reliability work.

Early Detection of Customer-Impacting Issues (Critical Customer Journeys)
With the launch of our India expansion, the team there built observability across critical customer journeys. 
As a result, we detected a problem with our 
web4
 server 
before customers were affected
, something that would have gone unnoticed in the past.
This is the kind of silent win that embodies our vision: stability and insight before disruption reaches our customers.
Ticket Volume Reduction
Through our combined efforts (code contributions, AI triage, automation, and observability), we’ve seen a 
sustained year-over-year decrease in tickets every month
. This shows we’re not just solving problems faster, we’re solving the right problems at the root.
Operational Excellence
We’re also driving operational excellence through practices and systems we've put in place to accelerate our maturity and impact as an SRE function.
Skybot Daily Monitoring: 
Daily monitoring activities (eyes-on-glass) to flag issues and critical job failures early. This enables us to resolve them 
before they escalate into customer-facing incidents
. More details can be found at the Slack channel 
#skybot-monitoring
 
Looking Ahead
Our trajectory is clear. As we continue building engineering proficiency in code, automation, and systems thinking, our team is becoming a 
strategic reliability partner
 to the broader organization. I’m excited about what’s next:
Expanding our code contribution footprint within product teams 
Scaling AI-based triage support across more services 
Defining and evangelizing SLOs (Service Level Objectives) with measurable reliability goals 
Continue to deliver critical customer journeys
Partnering earlier in the development lifecycle to 
design for reliability from day one
 
This transformation is not just about reducing tickets or increasing speed; it’s about building trust, preventing pain, and delighting our customers through 
invisible wins
.
The progress we’ve made this year reflects a team that’s growing in technical depth, maturity, and ambition.
