 What is Pre-Grooming?
Reviewing and researching stories ahead of Grooming. Team members will be assigned pre-grooming items during sprint planning or standup. 
 Goals
Be prepared for Grooming sessions by completing pre-grooming research
Outline the Acceptance Criteria for story
 Consider the following while researching your pre-grooming ticket:
Is the problem clear?
How would you approach this?
For bugs, have we identified all scenarios/steps to reproduce this?
What code, repositories, controls or pages are impacted?
Consider any Biller Options, settings, Invoice type settings, or misc. config
Does this require a database change?
Does this require any UI or design work?
Is this story dependent on another team for something?
Does this item require Architecture to assist in grooming?
What should be included in the Acceptance Criteria?
Do we need increased test coverage? Automation testing?
