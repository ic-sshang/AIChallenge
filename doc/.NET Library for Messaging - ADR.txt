Proposed
Context
Event driven architectures require messaging to handle asynchronous communication between services.  We need a .Net approach that will leverage the Azure Service Bus for messaging.
Requirements:
Must support both .Net 4.8 and dotnet 8
Must support Azure Service Bus
Must support Azure Service Bus Topics
Nice To Haves:
Support other Message Bus systems; RabbitMQ, Database, In-Memory
Alternatives Considered
MassTransit
Pros: Rich feature set, good documentation, supports multiple message brokers, supports sagas.
Cons: Steeper learning curve, more complex configuration, transitioned to a commercial licensing model with MassTransit v9.
Rebus
Pros: Easy to use, free, supports Azure Service Bus, can abstract other message bus providers like RabbitMQ, supports sagas.
Cons: Smaller community compared to MassTransit.
Wolverine
Pros: High performance, built-in support for advanced messaging patterns, supports sagas.
Cons: Less mature, smaller community, limited documentation, does not support .Net 4.8.
Azure Service Bus SDK
Pros: Direct integration with Azure Service Bus, reliable and well-supported by Microsoft.
Cons: Tied to Azure, lacks abstraction for other message brokers, does not support sagas.
Writing Our Own Library
Pros: Full control over implementation, tailored to our specific needs.
Cons: Significant development and maintenance effort, higher risk of bugs and security issues, lacks community support and documentation, does not leverage existing, battle-tested solutions.
Decision
We have decided to use the .NET Rebus library for our messaging needs.
Consequences
Positive
: Simplified development and maintenance, cost savings, flexibility in choosing message brokers, support for sagas, compatibility with both .NET Framework and .NET Core.
Negative
: Smaller community and fewer resources compared to MassTransit, potential need for custom solutions for advanced messaging patterns.
