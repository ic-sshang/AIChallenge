Summary
: This Technical Design only captures changes made to Minol in Q4 2024. The early Minol Technical Design is not documented at this time.
Minol processes credit card and ACH transactions in real-time using web services. Additionally, Minol utilizes Invoice Cloud to store payment methods and payment tokens for future auto-pay transactions. The "Additional Webservices" section of this documentation lists all the Invoice Cloud web services used.
