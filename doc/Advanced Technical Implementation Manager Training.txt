New Relic
New Relic is an observability platform that helps us build and monitor our software.
It allows us to confirm if our products are running successfully.
One of the most used services of New Relic for the Implementations and CS teams is 
Monitoring
:
Monitoring is the process of collecting and analyzing information like:
o Logs 
o Recorded events
o Performance metrics 
Monitoring tools help us:
o 
Track errors 
o Identify issues
o Send alerts / Notifications.

IC uses in New Relic
CS and IMs need to see logs for services that are configured to end logs to New Relic. Examples RTDR, DataPump, Email Queue, SSO and File processing research.
Logs can be queried by several conditions like BillerID, CustomerID, etc
Most useful for support teams looking for proof that an event occurred
Logs have a retention period of 30 days

Data Pump research
Search Logs using entity.name and Message.Properties.BillerId
Entity name holds the service.
Message holds the log contents.
Message.Properties.BillerId holdsBillerID.

RTDR Research
Similar to DataPump. Search Logs using entity.name andMessage.Properties.2RTDRlogs contain both request and response
Entity name holds the service.
Message holds the log contents.
Message.Properties.2 holds BillerID.
