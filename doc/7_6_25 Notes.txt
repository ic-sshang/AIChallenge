Implications of the Design System being built:
Papa Bill is building out components with code
Developers will be able to pull our DS components
Embeddable Micro Front Ends are being built
These will be web components that billers can embed in their interface
These organisms will be able to be completely re-styled by billers to match their branding
The MFEs are using our design system components (when they appear in our product)
Biller Portal Modals (legacy vs updated)
If the project is a new page in the biller portal:
Use new updated components
It will not match the rest of the biller portal legacy code
i.e. email domains designs should be built to match the figma file
For this project, the devs want to use teleric, but could use a mix of javascript
Progress Stepper Feedback 
 
Progress stepper should have a max width of 600px or 900px (pulling from our modal max width pattern)
As screen width lessens, the space in between the text columns would shrink until it hits the assigned column minimum width
Text wraps below
Edges of lines in between circles should be rounded
Checkmark should get smaller to give a little more space between vector and circle edge
Progress stepper will be set in green (NOT theme dependent)
