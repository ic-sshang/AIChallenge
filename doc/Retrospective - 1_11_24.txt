Azure Batch was not setup for MI. Took long time to configure and test it.
We need access to other repos quicker like ICPaymentProcessingAPI we got access till the end of the day
We need access to some logs resources
We could start to create a page with a list of repos and owners in order to have a kind of directory so when we need help for testing we can reach out to proper team.
Need to involve other TLs who own repos that we work on. Need their final approvals.
Shout out to Mauricio for taking the initiative to automate the Jira story creation for a huge number of repos.
To all the team for the effort on improving team’s productivity. Now tickets have been resolved faster.
