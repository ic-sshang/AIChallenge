Answer
: You can have a test funding batch for a test Paypal terminal seeded in the test Gateway DB which will get picked up when you run the Hyperwallet job which will add a entry to the OneBatch file generated.
Can we get the respective batch file names ? Answer: I believe 
DSDR file
 generated by Braintree and there is a 
One Batch file
 sent by IC to Braintree / Hyperwallet for Biller funding
Funded batches and unFunded batches
