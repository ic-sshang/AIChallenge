Overview
This set of articles describe the Azure AD Groups the InvoiceCloud Cloud Infrastructure team has created and manages.
The general pattern preferred and implemented by the InvoiceCloud Infrastructure and Platform team is to follow the pattern of a set of 3 AAD Groups (Admin, Developer, Reader) per Environment, which enable access to Azure Resources within each specific Environment.
Management
InvoiceCloud currently uses Azure DevOps as a Source Code Management and Deployment Management platform.  Below are the Azure DevOps resources related to the NextGen Azure Active Directory Group provisioning and management.
