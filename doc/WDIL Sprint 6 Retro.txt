Still need a testing template naming format
Potentially follow the format in EBPP-25109?

Preparing more items
as in for grooming??
Link Dev Support items or other related items to Spike/research items.

Not breaking user stories down (too many 8-point stories in a sprint)

Not picking items with unreasonable time frames (thanks Sarah!)
