Current Requirements Submitted under ticket
We request the creation of two new subscriptions within our Azure environment, specifically designated for our data warehousing needs. The subscriptions to be created are as follows:
Data Warehouse Development
 - This subscription will be used for development activities, including testing and staging of data warehousing solutions before they are moved to production.
Data Warehouse Production
 - This subscription will be designated for our production-grade data warehousing resources, hosting live datasets and serving as the backbone for our data-driven decision-making processes.
Ownership and Access Control:
Ownership of these subscriptions should be granted to Wesley Warren, the Director of Data Warehouse Engineering. This will ensure that the appropriate level of oversight and control is maintained over our data warehousing resources.
Reason for Request:
The creation of dedicated subscriptions for data warehousing purposes is a strategic move towards isolating and centralizing our data warehousing resources. This isolation is critical for several reasons:
Security and Compliance:
 Separating our data warehousing environment from application-specific subscriptions enhances our security posture. It allows for the implementation of more granular access controls and security policies tailored to the sensitivity of the data housed within. This isolation also simplifies compliance with data protection regulations, as it's easier to audit and enforce compliance measures in a centralized data environment.
Cost Management and Optimization:
 Having dedicated subscriptions for data warehousing enables more effective cost tracking and optimization. It allows for the implementation of budget alerts and cost management policies specific to data warehousing activities, ensuring that expenses are kept in check and resources are efficiently utilized.
Performance and Scalability:
 Isolating data warehousing in its own subscription ensures that resources dedicated to data processing and storage are not impacted by the demands of other applications. This separation helps in maintaining optimal performance levels and allows for the scaling of data warehousing resources independently of other services.
Disaster Recovery and Data Protection:
 Dedicated subscriptions facilitate the implementation of robust disaster recovery plans and data protection strategies. By segregating data warehousing resources, we can tailor backup and recovery solutions to meet the specific needs of our data warehouse, ensuring data integrity and availability.
Action Required:
We request the to initiate the creation of these subscriptions and grant the necessary ownership permissions to Wesley Warren. This action will empower our Data Warehouse Engineering team to further enhance our data management capabilities, supporting the organization's goals of data-driven decision-making and operational efficiency.

Questions
Where is Airflow deployment environment? Non Prod and prod?
What is linux baseline image created with Crowdstrike and other baseline components?
Who is responsible for keeping the linux patched?
Will these VMs be added to AAD? Hence access managed by AAD groups? - Yes
Deployer SP will need AAD role (which one?) - Michael/Keith
IC Tooling infrastructure for deployments - Michael/Keith/Scott
Linux VM deployment pattern - Single user per VM
RBAC role access per user (Role)?
Routing and FW set up for NonProd and Prod DW vnets/spokes - 
Not much needed as long as legacy PaaS resources are accessed
For outbound, can follow SauceLabs like model (east/west) - Iteration 2?

Notes - 5th March 2024
If current pv dns architecture followed, there will be need for secondary vnet/spoke to access west endpoints. Consideration for hub-v3 - Globalized pv dns zone structure
DR for DW - iteration 2
Can be further isolated by seperate vpn (WARP) endpoint in their resepctive vnet/spokes.
Notes - 21st May 2024
 was tasked to complete deployments of peered VNETs (Spokes) using TF in DW source repo. This repo was to be managed for drift by Wes. (Only statefiles will be stored in TF Cloud)
 agreed that current no AVDs are needed. What exists in nonprod , may need to be replicated in prod
 - please take a note of that
