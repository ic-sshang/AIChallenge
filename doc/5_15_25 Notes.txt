Summary of today's design system meeting:
Toggle by Bethany can be in our starling design system. The one with check mark when toggle is turned ON.
Saideep will improve the stepper component and add statuses for variants. (Review it with team and then publish in Starling).
We figured out that we 
don't have to
 show few visual elements all the time just to make them accessible by 'TAB' on keyboard. Visual elements can be in focus using 'TAB' key even when they are visible only on hover.
Discussions on Table:
Table cells with different variants like 1 liner, 1liner+help text, Icon or Image  with 1liner and image.
Most common action we do on table being a checkbox,
Fixed action on right (Like Kebab menu) so that actions will stay on right side even for devices with smaller widths.
Using right click of mouse  on a table row to get kebab icon list anywhere on the row.
Alternative interaction option:
