Screenshots of what is existing and what is being changed (UI) in my Figma files and Jira tickets +1
dev view in figma?
figma, share the css/”end design” components
Wrap info from figma for coding(UI)(style: color, font, etc..)
not giving enough context/details on figma (or in AC for visual changes) can miss “dynamic” vs static elements
doing work without getting credit(!)
missing alerts (I have updated the escalation policy in jira)
Adding lot of UI testing stories (stories need automation)
Forgetting reruns 
 
Give feedback of the UI (add/change)
Help with clarifications 
bringing questions early and code reviews while in progress
automation, tests, new tools / repos as needed
pushing platform improvements
