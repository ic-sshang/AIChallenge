Background:
 The Southern Farm Bureau ($86k MRR) is a strategic insurance customer helping IC break into the Guidewire market. They cover six states: Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina. The Farm Bureau manages the insurance policies, and each state has a federation that manages the membership payments. The project aims to move all federations and insurance payments to Invoice Cloud.
