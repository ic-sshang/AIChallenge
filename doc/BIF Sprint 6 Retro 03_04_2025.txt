Random Thoughts/Music Request
Adapting solid principles to refactors if time allows
More of a question: For a biller integration, is it too much to ask if the testing can be done in Devtest environment rather than using the test bids in prod?
Nothing bad this sprint :)
Rotating host of barbershop sessions
Weekly group learning session/activity
Not pulling in non-escalated items when work dries up at the end of sprint
Good for assisting with the other active items in the sprint
Good timing to be able to do things like Secure Code Warrior and any other business-mandated requirements
