Provisioning OAuth 2.0 credentials for a Biller is a manual process at the time of this writing.  There is a plan to integrate the Biller Portal to the Kong API to create the parent Biller consumer record and allow Billers to self-service managing OAuth applications under their consumer record.
Creating a OAuth 2.0 Application will allow a Biller to authenticate via the OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant and access APIs that require OAuth 2.0 authentication.
