Currently the OBD controller logs are located within the node they were run from. There is a limited amount of time that they are kept. I’m assuming this is the case for the icbatchtest batch account. More looking into needs to be done on this part.
To get to the logs, navigate to the nodes section of the OBDControllerPool and click on the idle node.
There will be a series of folders navigate to the following location:
Root/workitems/OBDAutoMatchController
Here you will see the last jobs ran. When clicking into one of the job folders, navigate down until you find the stdout.txt & stderr.txt files. These files will have the controllers output logs.
