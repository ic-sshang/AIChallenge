Interactive Voice Response (IVR) is an automated phone system technology that allows incoming callers to access information via a voice response system of pre-recorded messages without having to speak to an agent, as well as to utilize menu options via touch-tone keypad selection or speech recognition to have their call routed to specific departments or specialists.
In InvoiceCloud we use a variety of SOAP webservices under the umbrella namespace CloudIVRConnect to provide the information to these callers. 
To view the available SOAP webservices you must first have access to a Biller Portal > Support Tab > Documentation/APIS > Integration Documentation > Click on the InvoiceCloud Docs link. 
Once clicking on the link you will be taken to the InvoiceCloud Docs Site. 
This site has documentation on the various webservices that are being used by our system. 
CloudIVRConnect (IVR) is under the WebServices (SOAP) section. There you can find the available webservices offered. 
InvoiceCloud currently offers the following webservices for CloudIVRConnect:
