Details
Application Name
DataPump Threshold Predictor
Version
NA
Description
Python-based ML APIs to determine the alert metric type and value for monitoring biller API performance. The goal is to notify billers when their APIs, as invoked by the 
Datapump 
application, show signs of slow performance. One API trains the model using historical data, while the other predicts the alert value for the next hour based on the input dataset and trained model. Both APIs are hosted within the same application, which is currently being containerized.
This api predicts the following metrics values
Average Response Time
Error Rate Percentage
Timeout Error Rate
Primary Functionality
Expose API’s to Train a model using historical data and predict the trigger value for upcoming alerts.
Key Features
Time-Series & Regression Models, Python
