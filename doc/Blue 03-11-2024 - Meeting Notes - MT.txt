.Net Upgrade Part 3
Surface results from the recent scan 
- Team discussed EOL but need more details on the scan results.

CRM Web App
 
Review CRM build issue in depth via a actual example
- Mark has a pending branch where he converting it to a web app although there are some changes on how we use the bin folder. (Similar to what we went through with myiis and ic.common) 
- Need to identify how we can test the new changes. Discussion led to moving test project into CRM and running selenium tests to identify any content issues such as loading data. 
- CRM build is currently broken for dev’s locally but works if you build through CI/CD. 
- Not all Teams follow the process of having another member pull down the branch to confirm it can build for them. Teams will start to work on this process flow to prevent issues for others when approving PRs into CRM. 
Proxy Services DevTest
 
 
At times we lose access to DevTest due to proxy services are down. Tends to cause downtime for everyone for an hour or so. 
- Why are proxy services unavailable? 
- Decided that we will need to identify the root cause by reviewing logs on event viewer or on NR to solve the issue. Work with Vasant and his team on this.
