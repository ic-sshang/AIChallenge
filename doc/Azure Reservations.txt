Decision
n our recent analysis, we identified several underutilized virtual machines (VMs) and proposed resizing them to optimize our Azure reservations. This proposal includes new VM sizes that better match our current usage patterns, ensuring cost efficiency and resource optimization. Before proceeding with the resizing, we will take a complete backup of each VM to safeguard against any potential issues. If any problems arise during or after the resizing process, we will promptly revert to the original VM size or we will be using the backup and restore it, ensuring minimal disruption to our operations.
If everything goes well and we have enough evidence that there are no issues, we will be deleting the backups.
NON-PROD Findings 
: 
While testing the resize of machines on a test vm, we found that there are some limitations when resizing the vm’s. 
We cannot upgrade from dsv3 to dsv5, because dsv3 by default has a local storage. Which means we can only go to Ddsv5 from dsv3 which is costlier.
