Custom1 is used for InvoiceTypeID mapping (InvoiceTypeID value in BIF is ignored and replaced with this mapping). This mapping is setup in Advanced Setting 40.
Formatting example = 198(830,831)|199(840,841)|183(NA)
Groups are separated by a pipe
Number outside the parenthesis is the InvoiceTypeID
Branches values (from Custom1) are inside the parenthesis, comma separated
The last group is for defaults, anything not mapped on the previous groups will be set to the InvoiceTypeID for the (NA) group.
