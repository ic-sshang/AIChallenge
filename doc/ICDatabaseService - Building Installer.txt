Creating and installing a version of the InvoiceCloud Database Service on your AVD for testing/troubleshooting purposes:
Preparation:
Install NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) - Our line of ICSERVICES (DatabaseService, RTDR, Crypto, Business) services use this to create the installer.  I was able to install this without any additional permission on my non-prd AVD.
https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Main_Page
 
Clone ICDatabaseService from ADO
https://dev.azure.com/invoicecloud/Src/_git/ICDatabaseService
Ensure all nuget packages are installed and the project builds successfully.  
Creating the Installer
Select the 
Proxy 
Solution Configuration from the VS toolbar
Build the IC.WindowsServices.Database project
Verify that the output was directed to the bin\x86\Proxy folder like this
Open NSIS from your Start Menu
Select Compile NSIS scripts
Click Load Script icon to locate the NSIS installer file
The .nsi file is located in the IC.DatabaseWindowsService project that was built earlier.  Select that and click Open.
NSIS will immediately execute the file and generate the installer.  The output from the process will look like this.  Edits can be made to the .nsi file to evolve the installer to fit your needs.  It shouldn’t need an edit for these steps.
The generated installer is in the IC.WindowsServices.Database project folder
