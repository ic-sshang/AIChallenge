AZ BATCH 11/9/2022 Auto Payment Processing Critical Error
There is no action to take. This biller does not have AutoPay (it’s cloudstore only). This is another ERSO item we’ll need to research since it creates a false alarm. Thanks for following up!

AZ BATCH ICEmailQueueController Finished - 11/11/2022
This is the only AZ BATCH email this morning, do you know if this is normal? Are there any issues with the other emails?
General Notes
Mark Lagunez
If you’re thinking of the ICAutoPayController emails, the job finished at 9:50am and those emails have been sent out. It’s a different batch job. From the batch job perspective, we have:
autopay (includes scheduled payment, create late fees, and other steps) – starts about 3am CST
email processing – starts about 12am CST
high volume email processing – starts about 12am CST (shares job email alert with regular email processing)
autopayment / scheduled payment reminders – starts about 2:30pm CST
