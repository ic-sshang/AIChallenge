Customer Import options

Remove IT’s involvement when importing customer accounts 
without

​Process payments using the customer’s 
preferred saved payment method

Development​
When importing accounts for a customer with 
multiple saved payment methods
, the system sets the 
default payment method
 for 
ALL their accounts 
to the one on the account that was imported last.​
We are adding a new option to the CRM import tool to control this behavior.​

Improve Realtime Balances
​
Allow all billers to use the Search Invoices feature
Provide accurate invoice balances in the biller portal​
Researching​​
The “Search Invoices” feature is disabled for RTDR billers because we display outdated invoice balances in the results.​
​Challenge: slow RTDR performance on biller side + significantly more API calls​
​Potential solutions: update balances in real time while viewing the results OR update them ahead of time (prefetch).​
Intelligent Data Pump
​
Improve data pump success rate​​
Reduce need for manual intervention​
Exploring Options​
Problem: Billers miss datapump records while their server is down or undergoing maintenance.​
​Goal: Intelligently hold or re-send data pump records automatically​
Active/Inactive Report Delivery
​
Allow on-demand delivery​​
Add more scheduled frequency choices​
Development​
Billers use the Active/Inactive customer reports to compare with their system or make corrections to accounts that were mistakenly deactivated by CSRs.​
National Fuel Gas is requesting the ability to run these reports on-demand and schedule it more frequently. It is currently limited to being delivered monthly.​
Unplanned Go-live work (30%)​
​
Deliver go-live blockers and critical features​
Pending​
We typically spend ~30% of available resources on go-live blockers.​​

User Permissions​
​
Biller satisfaction​​
Planning for 2022 Q1-2​
Allow billers to create and manage “user roles” to define a set of permissions that can be applied to users.​​
​This is important for National Fuel because they will have 250 portal users to manage.​​
