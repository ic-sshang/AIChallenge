The purpose of this page is to provide the template that Project Managers will use for Steering Committee Meetings for projects over $50k MRR.
Here is the 
template
 we will use for Steering Committee meetings. 
Steering Committee Deck - Template.pptx (sharepoint.com)
Best Practices
Purpose
: The purpose of the steering committee is to gain alignment at the executive level.
Attendees
:
InvoiceCloud: Mark Daoust, Jared Tucker, Martha Greer, Caldwell Warley (FS) or Kinga Dobriban (GUB), Sarah Woodard (if heavy Product customization is required), Alliances, & delegates from CS (Stephen Williams, Anita Peterson, &/or Cat Kimler). Add TSM the last quarter before Go Live.
Biller: Work with your Project Manager/main point of contact to identify an executive sponsor on their side who will be part of the steering committee. If they are unable to provide an executive contact, escalate to the InvoiceCloud sales rep to help identify someone.
Frequency
: Once a month on average. Some projects may require more often and some less often.
Draft
: Collaborate with team members from Product, Integrations, Marketing, etc. when drafting the deck.
After the meeting
: Share the deck, Gong recording and meeting notes with everyone invited to the meeting.
