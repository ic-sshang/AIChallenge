1. Adoption Modeling
Objective:
 Estimate how many clients will adopt SSO/MFA and at what pace
Guidance
Steps:
Segment clients by vertical
 (government, utility, municipal, insurance).
Create adoption curves
 (conservative, baseline, aggressive) using historical adoption rates of similar features or market research.
Use a 
time-based ramp
 (e.g., 10% adoption in Year 1, 30% in Year 2, 50% in Year 3, etc.).
Adjust adoption rate based on:
Client size (by bill volume)
Regulatory pressure
 (e.g., stricter MFA requirements in government)
Digital maturity
 of the client
Signals we have to estimate adoption:
Biller survey, can be used to estimate percentages
Per Sarah, we can estimate 75% adoption for non-IMT billers in the insurance space
Per Ray, 60-70% large and medium carriers would adopt quickly - the rest over time

2. Usage Modeling
Objective:
 Estimate how often users will authenticate, and which authentication methods will be used
Guidance
Steps:
Use average number of 
logins per user per month
 (e.g., 3–5 times for B2B users).
Estimate user base per client (e.g., 5 users per small utility, 100+ for large insurer).
Break down login types:
SSO only
SSO + MFA
MFA (SMS vs. email vs. app-based TOTP)
Factor in password reset flows if you're also offering identity lifecycle management.
Can charge based on MAU or authorizations
Does charging based on authorization cover the full user lifecycle?
MAU
Would need count of users who authenticated at least once that month (we have this in IC)
Authorizations
How many active users do we have?  What’s the average be biller size segment?
How many authorizations are being performed by each user on average?  Does this change by size or vertical?
3. Cost Modeling
Objective:
 Identify and quantify direct and indirect costs
Guidance
Components:
a. 
Identity Provider (IdP) Licensing Fees
Price per 
monthly active user (MAU)
 or 
per authentication
 (based on provider: Auth0, PingIdentity, Azure AD, etc.)
Include 
tiered pricing
 or volume discounts

Cost per MAU
Cost per Auth

$0.001–$0.01
Varies by tier

b. 
MFA Delivery Costs
Email:
 $0.001–$0.005 per email
SMS:
 $0.01–$0.03 per message (US); varies internationally
Push-based MFA (e.g., Authenticator apps):
 Often no per-use cost, but platform fees apply
c. 
Support Costs
Initial support ticket lift due to onboarding
Ongoing support per auth incident (~$1–$5 per support ticket depending on severity)
Costs for platform usage
Auths
600,000 auths costs $32,772.71 = $0.06
250,000 auths costs $32,772.71 = $0.13 ← at current auth levels, this is our price point to break even for platform cost
MAU
14,000 MAU costs $32,772.71 = $2.34
Rule of thumb, software = 80-90% gross margin, give room to discount
Costs for MFA delivery
Emails/SMS
4. Revenue Modeling
Objective:
 Estimate revenue from offering SSO/MFA as a value-added service
Guidance
Steps:
Define pricing strategy:
Flat monthly fee per client
Per MAU or per authentication
Tiered pricing
 (Basic, Advanced, Enterprise)

5. Competitive Benchmarking
Objective:
 Understand what competitors charge and offer
Guidance
Steps:
Identify direct competitors (e.g., Paymentus, ACI, Kubra, One Inc)
Research:
Do they offer SSO/MFA?
Is it bundled or an add-on?
What are the price points?
Use public pricing or customer interviews to inform assumptions
6. Sensitivity Analysis
Objective:
 Understand how variables affect financial outcomes
Guidance
Include key variables:
Adoption rate (low/med/high)
Number of authentications per user
IdP pricing variance
SMS volume and carrier pricing
Revenue per client vs. costs
Build scenarios:
Best case:
 High adoption, high per-client revenue
Expected case:
 Baseline assumptions
Worst case:
 Low adoption, high SMS usage
7. Financial Model Output
Guidance
Deliverables:
P&L impact by year (3–5 year projection)
Per-client profitability
