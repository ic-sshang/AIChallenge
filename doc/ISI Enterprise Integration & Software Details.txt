All BIF customizations are in the ISI file 
When there’s a change to the balance of an invoice due to activity in ISI Enterprise, ISI sends IC a type 'R' record to overwrite the previous invoice. 
We also call the following service to update invoice balances but only when we are zeroing out / closing an invoice
Adjustments/Balances
ISI uses two methods to update invoice balances:
BIF invoice 'R' records to replace records due to inactivity
SetInvoiceBalance
 is used to zero out / close an invoice

PaymentReportingSOAPWithEchoAndCardTypeFromGMT
IC Web Services
ISI uses IC web service to pull payments. The frequency is set by each biller but these services are typically called every 2-5 minutes with a cutoff date/time set to the time of the previous run.
ISI also pulls batch settlement details for each biller using BillerSettledBatchSummarySOAP. If ISI finds a settled batch they have not seen before, they use the following service to download a list of payments and link them together into a batch for bank reconciliation: BillerSettledBatchDetailSOAP.

ISI GetDocument web service
ISI refers to the web service URL as the "endpoint" and the key/password the "session ID". The production password/session ID will be the same for all billers but you will need to get a specific URL/endpoint to setup the PDF Linking IT request during test (change the URL/endpoint at go-live). These are configured in CRM Advanced Settings.

Standard call flow
During kick-off, it's important to ask about the 'accountnumber' being a numeric digit (for use in the IVR search as well as displayed on the invoices) so it can be used for the IVR set up. This value (if numeric) would be in the ‘displayaccountnumber’ field for advancedIVRsearch to be used for the search method.
