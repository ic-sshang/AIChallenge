Integration Requirements and Pre-Requisites
For Billers running the Cayenta Customer Self Service portal (which we have a SSO with) and are running it as an ‘on premise’ solution, we need the Biller to set up an external server. Biller may need to purchase a new external server and 
Cayenta helps Biller configure the external server. 
Invoice Cloud is not involved in the request process at all and it is handled between Cayenta and the Biller. 
Cayenta needs to provide IC with endpoints. 
IP addresses will be whitelisted directly through Cayenta and/or the Biller. Cayenta and the Biller’s IT should get the whitelist.
Biller must be on CU Version 7.9.0 or higher and CSS gen 3 to support POSConnect

Sample Biller Implementation
City of Roseville (BID 827) – SSO
DPU City of Orangeburg (BID 1003) – SSO
City of Gresham (BID 1236) – SSO
Planning
Test Portals
IC Hosted Test Portal: 
Harris Cayenta Test (BID 161)
Partner Hosted Test Portal
:
Invoice Cloud does not have access to Cayenta Test Portal. 
Biller Test Portal:
Best practice is to set up a production and test portal in CRM for each biller. Check with your Cayenta team to determine if this is needed. 
Occasionally the same web service info is used and pointed to test during test, then pointed to prod at go live. If the same web service info is used in Prod and Test, a test portal cannot be set up (two portals using the same Web Service URLs is not supported in IC).
Rules of Engagement
Prior to the kickoff call, reach out to Ricky Chiang (
RChiang@harriscomputer.com
) and Donna Parker (
dparker@cayenta.com
) at Cayenta and see if they are ready to start the project and what their timeline to start will be. 
Make sure to include Cayenta contacts on kick-off call and project status meetings.
Timeline
Estimated timeframe to complete implementation
90 - 120 Days
