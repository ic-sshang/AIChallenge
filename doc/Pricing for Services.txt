How do I determine Biller size and segmentation? 
GUB/Utility - based on Meter Count*
Mid Market: 1,800 - 15k meters
Field: 15k-125k meters
Enterprise: 125k+ meters
Insurance - based on Direct Written Premium (DWP)*
Insurance Mid-Market: $10m - $250m DWP
Insurance Field:  $250m - $2b DWP
Insurance Enterprise: $2b+ DWP
County Tax 
Country tax segmentation is still being developed. In the meantime, consider all County Tax Billers in the Field segment. 
* DWP and Meter count can both be found on the Salesforce Account record.
