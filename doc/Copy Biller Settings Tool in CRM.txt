Prepare this section for the review meeting
 Problem Alignment
Implementation Project Managers are often tasked with creating at least 2 BIDs for new Billers; one for Production use and one for ongoing testing. In rare cases, several environments (3-5) must be created to account for all the Biller's lower environments. The configuration for these BIDs must be identical to ensure functionality, behaviors, and outcomes are consistent between testing and live use. This introduces a unique challenge for the Implementation teams, as there are hundreds of settings and configurations that must be checked to ensure consistency.
 Objective
Create a new tool in the CRM which allows the user to copy various configurations from one Biller to another. The “source” Biller may exist in any state, but the “target” Biller must be in Demo mode. Configuration areas that are available to copy include Invoice Types (and their settings), Biller Options, E-Mail templates, Virtual Site/Customer Portal components, and/or Invoicing components.
 Success Metrics
List the project goals and metrics that will be used to determine its success.

 Requirements
Requirements supporting background: 
Previously we have had billers want to use the 3rd notification for sending notifications of close to stop service, however if they are a balance forward biller, which most utilities are, and their shutoff timeline is into the next billing cycle period then it starts to get confusing as to the new invoice and the balance.  
Its common that billers will want to send a delinquency notification automatically once they get X number of days past the due date.

 Competitive Analysis
N/A
 Dependencies
Dependencies are around working with a dedicated and narrow group of partners. It will be dependent on integrations with the partners to actually send service or policy updates back. InvoiceCloud will be responsible taking payments and account notifications but the CIS systems will be responsible for posting back for actual shut off service.
 Assumptions
List any assumptions you have about your users, technical constrains, business goals, etc.
This tool is intended to be used by the IC Implementations teams
The tool will only be available to CRM users with the given user permission. 
The tool will not permit the user to copy settings to a Live Biller
The process will allow for up to 100 concurrent executions
