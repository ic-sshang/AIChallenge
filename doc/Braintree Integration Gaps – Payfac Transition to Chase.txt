As we progress with integrating Braintree into our Payfac model under Chase, the following gaps have been identified. These should be carefully considered and addressed to ensure a smooth transition and operational efficiency.
1. Transaction Lifecycle Visibility
Current State:
The source of truth for transaction data resides in the gateway database. Reporting, however, is split between the gateway and the biller shard.
Challenge:
Billers only have access to the shard data,
 which limits their ability to view the complete transaction lifecycle. This includes critical events such as refunds, chargebacks, and reversals. 
Recon team has access to the shard data and gateway data although they still have lack of visibility when there are any issues with importing data or failed payments. 
2. Reverse Money Movement
Current State:
The process for reversing funds (e.g., refunds, chargebacks) differs significantly between
 IC (Invoice Cloud)
 and PSN (Payment Service Network).
Challenge:
There is a lack of clarity on how reverse money movement should be handled under the Payfac model.
3. Internal Reporting
Current State:
Reporting capabilities for the Reconciliation Team are limited and involve manual processes.
Challenge:
The current reporting tools do not fully support automated reconciliation, increasing the risk of errors and inefficiencies.
