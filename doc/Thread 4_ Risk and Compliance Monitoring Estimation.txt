Level of Effort Assumption
Level of Effort (LOE) estimates
 represent the approximate duration required to complete work, based on a typical delivery team of 3–4 resources. These estimates assume that teams can execute the work without external dependencies or constraints.
With a typical team size, the estimated level of effort is:
X-Small
 – Approximately 
0.5 month
Small
 – Approximately 
1 month
Medium
 – Approximately 
2 months
Large
 – Approximately 
3 months
X-Large
 – Approximately 
6 months
Medium Rock

Payer Fraud Monitoring (Card Testing, Velocity)
Detect and mitigate payer-side fraud (card testing, velocity spikes, stolen BINs). Critical to prevent scheme fines and Chase termination risk.
🟢 
Ops/Policy
Use 
existing Kount integration
 for card testing alerts.
Ops runs 
basic velocity checks
 (txn/min, $ thresholds) manually.
Consume 
Chase/network fraud alerts
 via email/CSV.
Manual evidence capture
: log alerts, actions in CRM/spreadsheets.
Fallback:
 Ops manually inspects raw txn logs if feeds unavailable.

Partial Dev {based on learnings}
Support 
configurable velocity rules
: txn counts, dollar caps, BIN/MCC anomalies.
Build 
Ops Fraud Dashboard
:
Real-time fraud alerts, reason codes, statuses (open, false positive, escalated).
Allow Ops to suppress false positives; Compliance to approve escalations.
Persist 
Kount txn IDs + triggered rules
 in audit logs.
Send 
notifications
: in-app + email alerts when rules breached.

Fraud evidence retention

Who owns fraud triage SLA — 
Ops or Compliance

Biller AML Monitoring
Detect suspicious 
biller-level activity
 (refund laundering, abnormal deposits). Supports AML/FinCEN compliance.
🟢 
Ops Policy:
 Manual reviews of refunds + high-risk patterns in reports.
Finance/Ops manually logs/reports suspicious activity.
Manual check:
>X% refunds, round-dollar spikes, high deposit velocity

Chargeback & Dispute Monitoring
Track chargeback ratios against network thresholds (Visa 1%, MC 0.9%). Must-have for scheme compliance.

Ops Policy:
Ops manually tracks ratios using Chase/Amex outputs. 
Finance calculates ratios in spreadsheets.

Chargeback UI workflow
 for billers to self-serve dispute management.
Intelligent recommendations
 (e.g., based on reason code, transaction type, past outcomes) to guide billers on whether to accept or challenge disputes.
Evidence collection & submission
: billers upload supporting docs; IC aggregates and forwards to Chase.
Finance impact visibility
: billers see disputed amount, fees, potential recovery.
Automated timelines
: SLA countdowns for representment, pre-arbitration, arbitration.
Decision logging
: system tracks whether biller accepted, challenged, or ignored dispute.
Escalation workflows
: Ops/Compliance notified if deadlines missed or biller chooses arbitration.
Reporting dashboards
: win/loss rates, average dispute resolution time, financial impact trends.
SOC2/SOX-ready audit trail
: every action (who/what/when) logged and exportable for regulators.
