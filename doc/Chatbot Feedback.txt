Try new LLM error message
7/7
General
Certain responses prompt a 401 error and request to try new LLM model
This should not prompt such a error to the payer. Instead it should be more user friendly and instruct payer how to reset session to continue conversation or instructions towards speaking with a representative.
STILL NEED TO GET TO PROMPT
Introductory message seems a bit too long now.
(RESOLVED - NONPAYMENT INQUIRIES, JUST NEED TO MAKE MESSAGE CLEANER)

General
Addressed non-payment inquirie statement. Just needs to be a little more short and concise.

Error: HTTP 401: . Try with another llm model pops up on bottom right. 2 invoices. One was already 0 balance. If you ask for another, you get a wrong LLM model message as seen on the bottom right.
Should be able to look up another invoice. Noted comment about not being included in MVP. If this cannot be done, the payer needs to be prompted on how to get it done or to refresh the session to start a new payment session.

How can I contact you?Can I speak to a live agent? How can I contact you for more help? (PROMPT ADJUSTMENT)
7/7
Non-Payment
It is now prompting which is great; however, we need to make sure it is sharing the correct e-mails. When I asked it 2 general questions, it prompted to me e-mail the mayor@mishawaska and also another general question prompted me to ask mubilling@mishawaska.
Payment related inqiuiries that cannot be addressed should be forwarded to mubilling@mishawaska and NON-payment related inquiries should be forwarded to mayor@mishawaska; or maybe even a general email that they have. Not sure if Mayor is the right one but we should have flexibility around that. New screenshot attached.

Where is chatbot? (ISSUE IS IC EMPLOYEES NOT ON WARP CANNOT SEE IT)
7/8
General
I don’t see where to begin the conversation?
At least an icon to click, better would be the window open automatically.
Prompt: How can I enable autopay?
7/9
Payment related
The response provides instructions on how to do it on the customer portal dashboard AND prompts the payer to enable autopay on the chat window.
Instructions should only populate for Pay by Text, as the chatbot currently supports autopay / paperless; there is no need to put instructions on how to do it on the dashboard.
Prompt: Can I enable autopay?
7/9
Payment Related
Response: Since there is no outstanding balance, you won't be able to set up AutoPay at this moment. AutoPay requires a valid payment method and an outstanding balance to process payments.If you have any other questions or need assistance with something else, feel free to ask!
Should be able to enable autopay with or without an outstanding balance
OpenAI filtering and block response prompts

Technical
Depending on user input, OpenAI is filtering and blocking response prompts which lead to a red message ‘Try new LLM model’ to appear in widget

If autopay is enabled but paperless is not, prompt just confirms with autopay.
Should prompt; something similar to “I see you have autopay enabled. Would you like to go paperless as well?
