Intake 
Potential Conversion Team projects are reviewed initially by the Conversion Manager and Conversion Specialist/PM assisting with the Triage process to confirm all necessary information has been received, and the project is appropriate for Conversions. 
The Conversion Specialist/PM assisting with the Triage completes the Intake Sheet.
If there is any need for additional discussion, the project is brought up during the Conversion team meeting. 
If additional information is needed or if it is not a Conversion project, it is returned to the originator for clarification or action.
