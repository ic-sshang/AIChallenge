There is a test DB catalog hosted on the production DB server.   This prevents segmentation. 
High
Skybot Jobs 
A handful of multi stepped jobs use local disk storage with the assumption that the next step will be able to access the same local storage.  This prevents jobs from being able to freely move to app servers.
Low
IC.Database Library
Old versions of this library are in the IC nuget feed.  Old versions allow misconfigured software to connect to production databases.
High
Managed Identity
We have code repositories that have not implemented MI for connecting to Key Vaults or Databases.  This becomes a blocker when a enhancement needs to be made in these repositories.
MI provisioning needs to be formalized and tested.
Should we still use MI for database access?
