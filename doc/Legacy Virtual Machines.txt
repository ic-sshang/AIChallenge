Virtual Machine Host Groups
At InvoiceCloud we have 6 Groups (Pools) of Virtual Machines that server the host a majority of our Legacy Applications (which is around 95% of current InvoiceCloud applications).
The Virtual Machine Host Groups (Pools) are:
Web Servers
Responsibility: Hosting of InvoiceCloud’s 3 main Applications 1) CRM, 2) Biller Portal, and 3) Payer Portal, as well as the APIs and other Services needed to support those 3 main Applications.
App Servers
Responsibility: Hosting of Background Job Processes (SkyBot Jobs) that accomplish a variety of Tasks.
Skybot Servers
IC-Skybot1 and IC-Skybot2
Responsibility: host the Skybot control / management plane, which orchestrates the jobs running on the App Servers
Proxy Servers
 Responsibility: Hosting of 5 WCF Services that sit in front of other Resources such as the Azure SQL Server or Azure Storage Accounts and act as a access gatekeeper and encapsulate certain functionality associated with interactions with the Resources they sit in front of.
Gateway Servers
Responsibility: Hosting of 3 APIs that are used by PSN for interacting with our systems.
PDF Extract Servers
Responsibility: Hosting of the PDF Extract Background Job Process, which extracts Invoice Data from .pdf files provided by our Billers.
MCC Servers
Responsibility: Hosting of the MCC Application and Services (a company we acquired that which some of our Biller base use to process transactions).
The Virtual Machines have different levels of parity and support in our lower
