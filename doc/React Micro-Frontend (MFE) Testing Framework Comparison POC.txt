Objective
The goal of this document is to present a proof of concept (POC) and comparative analysis of popular testing tools for React applications. Based on this, we propose adopting Jest + React Testing Library (RTL) as the default testing strategy for the new and expanding MFE architecture.
Testing Tools Compared

Type                    
Features                      
Pros                                
Cons
 
Jest + React Testing Library (RTL)
 
Unit + Integration
DOM testing, easy-to-read tests, works well with hooks
Easy setup, good community support, focuses on behavior over implementation
 
Slightly verbose with few complex DOM states
 
 
 
Enzyme
 
 
 
Unit
 
Component rendering (shallow, mount), lifecycle methods access
 
 
 
Closer access to component internals
Not actively maintained, limited support for React 18+, shallow rendering is anti- pattern
 
 
Cypress
 
E2E +
Component Testing
Browser-based UI testing, supports interaction
 
Great for full UI testing, real browser environment
 
Slower than unit tests, higher setup overhead
 
Playwright / Puppeteer
 
E2E
Headless browser automation
Fast, scriptable, supports multiple browsers
 
Best suited for E2E, not unit testing
Why Choose Jest + React Testing Library
Alignment with MFE Goals: RTL encourages writing tests from the user’s perspective — perfect for isolated, consumer-facing MFE components.
Future-Proof: Enzyme is no longer officially maintained and lacks support for new React features like Suspense and Concurrent Mode.
Community & Ecosystem: Jest + RTL are the industry standard for React unit/integration tests. Maintained by the React community and used by Facebook, Airbnb, etc.
Speed and Simplicity: Jest is fast, provides snapshot testing, and works out-of-the-box with React Testing Library.
Sample Code Demonstration
SampleComponent.tsx
typescript
import React from "react";

interface SampleComponentProps {
  title?: string;
}

const SampleComponent: React.FC<SampleComponentProps> = ({ title = "Hello, World!" }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <p>This is a sample component rendering basic HTML using TypeScript and React.</p>
      <button onClick={() => alert("Button clicked!")}>Click Me</button>
    </div>
  );
};
SampleComponent.test.tsx
typescript
import React from "react";
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from "@testing-library/react";
import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
import SampleComponent from "./SampleComponent";

describe("SampleComponent", () => {
  it("renders the default title and paragraph", () => {
    render(<SampleComponent />);
    expect(screen.getByText("Hello, World!")).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText(/sample component/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it("renders a custom title when provided", () => {
    render(<SampleComponent title="Custom Title" />);
    expect(screen.getByText("Custom Title")).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it("shows alert when button is clicked", () => {
    window.alert = jest.fn();
    render(<SampleComponent />);
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByText("Click Me"));
    expect(window.alert).toHaveBeenCalledWith("Button clicked!");
  });
});

Attached Snapshots
·       We can easily visualize the output of the component in debug console. (which makes it more efficient compared to others as it’s testing end UI instead of only focusing on unit testing.)

Additional Benefits
Snapshot Testing: Catch unintended UI changes with Jest snapshots.
Code Coverage: Jest easily provides coverage reports to ensure test completeness.
Mocking & Isolation: Jest mocks modules and APIs efficiently, supporting isolated unit tests.
Proposed Strategy

Conclusion
Jest + React Testing Library is the most maintainable, scalable, and developer-friendly choice for testing our React MFE architecture moving forward. It strikes a balance between test clarity, coverage, and future readiness.
Recommendation
: Approve and standardize Jest + RTL as our default testing stack for MFE React projects.
