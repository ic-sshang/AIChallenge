Data Synchronization Integration
Guidewire Cloud Native default integration is used for Texas Mutual Insurance. The only difference from the default integration is that they will be sending only most recent invoice for RTDR balances due to them using Balance Forward.

User Experience Integration
This section documents the initial, recommended user experience design for this integration. Since user experience integration uses Invoice Cloud web services that are available to a Biller, it’s possible for the Biller to change at any time without notifying Invoice Cloud after Go-Live how they use our web services.
Registered users will log in through the TMO portal with SAMLSSO. The SSO URL will redirect users to the InvoiceCloud registered user experience and payment path pages, such as paperless preference, saved payment methods, open bills, etc. The integration with the Policy Holder will be done through iFrames for the payment path with CloudPayv2. All account management pages with SAML SSO will be done through a new tab due to security concerns. 
TXM will be using Cloud Pay v2 for one-time payments on the registered route and using SAMLSSO for account management. Authentication token will be used to process one-time payments with CloudPayv2. LoginGUID will not be stored in TXM system due to security concerns and this value will be retrieved with the webservice call: Retrieve Users. TXM is going to use InvoiceCloud Registration API with the LoginGUID as the password before the user accesses Cloud Pay v2 to process a payment so that the forced SAML SSO redirect is not required.  
Single Sign On
Purpose/Summary: SAML SSO account management pages will be used. The connection/registration will occur with a temp password with registration webservice call first. The password will be updated with the LoginGUID to allow SAML redirect/iFraming to occur later on.

File Mapping
Invoice File
Texas Mutual Insurance will utilize the out of the box Guidewire Billing Center which will include the REST OAuth2.0 webservice for uploading invoices. The REST endpoints will be added to the Accelerator by Nov 5, 2025.  
The OOTB accelerator creates the invoice file per billed invoice data available on BC with the current invoice due and the total amount due on the premium. The balance update API will update these values accordingly when the account is being accessed. Changes can also be made to the accelerator when creating the BIF to send the current due as (past due + current due).  
Cloud Pay v2 will be used to process payments on InvoiceCloud registered policy holder experience with the invoice number matching what was sent via BIF.  
The below payment types do have invoices available on TXM, however, they are not invoices that have been created and are available on Billing Center. For the time being, these invoices will be created on the fly with Cloud Pay v2.
