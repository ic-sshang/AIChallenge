There are 2 ways to handle the payment coming from Invoice Cloud and the choice is (the Biller's) on how it will be handled:
Through pending payments or live to the account. If you go the pending payments route, all payments downloaded from Invoice Cloud will sit in the View Pending Payments screen under Batch Entries until someone (the biller) goes in and manually posts them.
If you choose to go the live route, all payments downloaded from Invoice Cloud will be posted directly to the customers’ accounts by a dummy clerk we (inHance) set up named IC Clerk. You (biller) will get a report through Open Transactions for this clerk for all payments made that day.

InHance Auto Pay job: This job downloads a flag that tells inHance that Invoice Cloud will handle the ACH. When inHance downloads this flag, they set the customer to Draft and put dummy bank account info on the account. The bank name is Invoice Cloud Bank and the account number is 000000000 with a dummy routing number. If the biller does not currently handle any bank drafts at all, the biller will need to make sure they are including drafts when printing bills
