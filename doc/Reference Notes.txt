Thread 2 — Processor Integration & Payment Routing (verbatim from Aug 14 session)
1) American Express (processing path) & TPSP sunset
Facts stated
Team wants to escalate within Amex to confirm if 
OptBlue
 can remain an option; it’s seen as “the least amount of work.” A meeting was set for 
Aug 25
 with 
Neil
 (Amex account manager level), with recognition that escalation to 
Amex leadership
 may be required.
Amex previously 
funded $300,000
 toward a 
Braintree strategic aggregator
 build and may expect InvoiceCloud to continue on an aggregator path.
The current 
TPSP model is planned to sunset
; timelines have slipped because many clients remain on it, but the stated direction is to end TPSP.
Two 
strategic aggregator
 options were discussed: 
(a)
 direct to Amex; 
(b)
 
conveyance via Chase
 (Amex product routed through Chase). Conveyance would require Chase dev work to send specific mapping fields back to Amex so they can retain account history continuity.
Chase 
conveyance
 is on a 
2026 roadmap
 (no committed quarter/resource assignment). Amex has 
escalated
 with Chase; Chase would need to add development either way (OptBlue or conveyance).
For 
strategic aggregator
 (either path), 
settlement is net-only
 (discount fees/chargebacks deducted). OptBlue was characterized as a lighter lift.
Implications discussed
Net-only from Amex aggregator conflicts with many 
gross-deposit
 expectations; could create 
FBO negative balance risk
 if IC pays billers gross while receiving net from Amex. 
Reserves
 and daily fee debits were mentioned as considerations.
Open questions captured
Whether 
OptBlue
 is truly allowed given IC’s scale; whether 
executive approval
 can secure it.
Actual 
funding timing
 and any 
delays
 when routing via Chase vs direct Amex aggregator.
2) POS / Card-present (Bluefin, Datacap, BYOD)
Facts stated
Bluefin
 is 
not PayFac-certified on Chase Commerce
 today; path forward unclear. 
NMI
 was mentioned but 
not PF-certified
; 
Datacap
 was raised as 
PF-certified
 and recommended by Chase.
A large installed base of 
existing devices
 was noted (example: PSN ~
500
 devices); 
device swaps
 are 
slow and painful
; 
BYOD
 under PayFac was said to be 
not supported
 and would need replacement.
There was debate on whether POS must be 
day-1
 vs 
staged
 by cohorts; some argued it’s strategically important and should be ready day-1; others noted migration realities may push POS later in the program.
Open questions captured
Whether 
Bluefin
 will engage for PayFac on Commerce; 
Chris/Steve will own 
Datacap
 outreach - in progress
3) Sub-merchant model & ID strategy (Merchant Order Number)
Facts stated
Team aligned on using 
Merchant Order Number (MON)
 as the 
primary key
 for reporting/settlement reconciliation with Chase; Chase returns MON in files/reports for lifecycle tracking (success, failures, chargebacks).
Proposed MON composition discussed: 
Biller ID (BID) + Invoice Type (aka “invoice type ID”) + per-payment transaction suffix
, ensuring readability (BID visible) and uniqueness. 
Chase API supports 
up to ~40 characters
; 
22
 was also mentioned in current IC context—both values surfaced in the dialogue.
MCC
 needs to be 
captured per invoice type
 and 
sent
 to Chase alongside MON.
Funding instructions
 can vary 
per invoice type
; in many cases they may also roll up to a single account—both patterns exist today in practice.
A future 
“super-biller” reporting hierarchy
 was discussed (parent/brand/locations model). Today, processing/reporting remains at 
BID
 level; super-biller was framed as 
reporting roll-up
, not a processing entity. {Roopa to work with Sarah to understand need for future proofing.}
Terminology debate captured
Whether to label the parent 
Biller
 as 
Merchant
 or 
Sub-merchant
; and what to call the invoice-type level. No final naming decision was taken; agreement to revisit after walking through 
funding
 and 
boarding
 flows.
4) Settlement modes & fee handling (gross / net / daily debit)
Facts stated
Three flavors
 discussed:
(a)
 
Gross deposit
 to biller with 
monthly
 invoicing of fees;
(b)
 
Gross deposit
 with 
daily debit
 of merchant/processing fees (to reduce float);
(c)
 
Net
 settlement (deposit already reduced by fees/chargebacks).
For 
Amex strategic aggregator
, 
net-only
 was reiterated (both via Chase conveyance and direct).
Concerns: 
FBO negative
 scenarios if IC fronts gross while receiving net; 
interchange
 uncertainty until settlement; 
daily fee debit
 could add 
noise/complexity
 for billers.
Past processor experience (non-EBPP vertical) indicated some PayFacs 
preferred net
 for cleaner cash use; others in IC’s space 
see gross
 as simpler for reconciliation—both views were recorded.
It was noted 
Chase
 (as acquirer) can deposit 
gross
 and 
debit fees
, and there was discussion about the ability to 
designate net
 into the FBO for specific slices (e.g., cost-plus) vs Chase’s general stance—this needs confirmation in funding design. 
Different MIDs
 at Chase may be required for 
net vs gross
 processing, per the discussion.
Open questions captured
Granularity of settlement mode
 (parent vs invoice-type vs finer slices like 
invoice type × payment source × method
)—raised as a funding-config topic.
5) Routing policy & slices
Facts stated
The team wants routing that can slice by 
invoice type
, 
payment source
, and 
payment method
; each slice could map to different 
bank accounts
 and potentially different 
settlement modes
 (net/gross).
For 
non-Chase rails
 (e.g., 
PayPal
, 
Fiserv RPPS
), existing identifier patterns differ: PayPal uses vendor-specific IDs (MID/MAID); RPPS is per-BID. IC currently uses constructs like 
BID|terminal
 for PayPal mapping.
Open questions captured
How to 
normalize
 cross-rail IDs with the 
MON
 strategy, and where to 
store vendor-specific identifiers
 alongside MON for consistent reporting.
6) Migration & coexistence
Facts stated
Expect 
parallel
 processing during migration (legacy vs PayFac) while device swaps and routing changes progress; 
POS-heavy
 cohorts might be deferred later in the program.
7) Tokenization & Card Updater (related, not a day-1 dependency)
Facts stated
Network tokenization
 is 
not required
 for PayFac 
day-1
; it is 
related but independent
. 
Card updater
 demand is 
rising
 (especially insurance/up-market).
Options under exploration: 
Chase
 account updater vs 
third-party
 vs 
direct with networks
; 
Chase
 cannot support network tokenization 
outside Chase cards
. No vendor choice or timing was decided in this meeting.
8) Bank account validation pricing (context impacting funds movement)
Facts stated
Chase
 validation pricing was cited around 
$0.21
 (dropping to 
$0.19) per validation, viewed as 
too expensive
 relative to prior 
Certegy
 costs (
$0.03–$0.04
, “not apples to apples”). 
EWS
 (Early Warning) was noted as underlying for many vendors. This isn’t a day-1 routing dependency but affects overall payments cost structure.
9) What the group explicitly parked to future sessions
Funding configuration
 depth (where to set net/gross; per-slice granularity; UI walk-through).
Boarding/CRM wizard
 alignment with the sub-merchant model and funding flow (include India team; end-to-end configuration walk-through).
Terminology
 (merchant vs sub-merchant vs invoice type) to be finalized after funding/boarding reviews.
