Random Thoughts/Music Request
Reorder the to-do queue based on priority at the start of the sprint +2
Depending on the change in code when using data, maybe start requesting for new data and try to stay away from the old ones in Unit Tests
More of a question, are there plans to change how we will be handling future data conversions?
Is there a way to let the reporters know that all prerequisites are needed before the conversion is requested
Do not forget about reviewing the ITG queue. 
Maybe do a quick review of the queue during the Stand-Up?
Do not “cherry pick” data for testing, make sure to use whole amounts of data
Waiting to create the INT for data conversions until all the requirements have been validated +2 
 
Hosting Retro after the first day of the sprint
Having parking lot after standup
Reviewing PRs in Final Review before the last second
