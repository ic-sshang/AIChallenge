Given that we have multiple engineering teams on the same sprint calendar and sprint cycles are demanding, 
monthly activities
 would be more manageable.. This ensures the team gets a break, without adding too much to their plate on a bi-weekly basis. We should still tie in smaller, informal celebrations or shoutouts after each sprint to keep engagement alive (during retros/demos), but larger fun activities can be done once a month for higher impact and less disruption.
Plan
Monthly Activities
: Schedule engaging activities on the last Friday of every month from 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM.
Benefits
Regular fun activities will help maintain high levels of employee engagement, making work feel more enjoyable.
These activities provide opportunities for employees to connect, collaborate, and build relationships outside of their regular work tasks.
Fostering a positive work culture contributes to increased job satisfaction and overall well-being among team members.
Involving team members in the planning and execution of activities helps develop their leadership skills and promotes ownership and accountability.
Rotating responsibilities encourages creativity and ensures that various interests are represented, catering to a wide range of preferences within the teams.
