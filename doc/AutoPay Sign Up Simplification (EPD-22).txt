Problem Statement
note
AutoPay is a key adoption and revenue driver but the experience to set up, manage, or edit AutoPay for our payers is confusing and often misunderstood. This can lead to payers attempting to enroll in AutoPay but not complete it unknowingly, causing missed payments or confusion and calls in to support. 


AutoPay is a key adoption and revenue driver but the experience to set up, manage, or edit AutoPay for our payers is confusing and often misunderstood. This can lead to payers attempting to enroll in AutoPay but not complete it unknowingly, causing missed payments or confusion and calls in to support. 


Problem 1: Misunderstanding of AutoPay
These are main questions that payers have regarding AutoPay:
Which invoices are on AutoPay?
What payment method is being used for my AutoPay?
What date will AutoPay run? 
What is the AutoPay schedule? 
What date will AutoPay be deducted and from which of my saved payment methods?
Is there a fee for AutoPay? Is the fee included?
Problem 2: Payers must set up default payment method to enroll in AutoPay
The current AutoPay flow forces payers to jump back and forth from two sections and leads to confusion. Payers need more hand-holding in this process or an intuitive flow with a “wizard” to guide them in the AutoPay enrollment process.
How do I change my AutoPay payment method?
Why must I set up a saved payment method before setting up AutoPay – can’t I do this at the same time?
