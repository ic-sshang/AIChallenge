Software Product Name
Munis
MUNIS aka Tyler Technologies
Munis ASP is the FTP solution for a Biller using the Munis software. A Munis integration will have the Stratus desktop application installed on the Biller's machine. The difference between a standard Munis integration and a Munis integration with Munis ASP is that Munis ASP can deliver files via FTP. The software will send Daily Balance Adjustment files to our FTP to a directory assigned for the biller.
Software Cashiering System
Tyler Cashiering
If a Biller wants card readers, SRED is strongly recommended for any Biller without the MUNIS cashier product. 
EMV devices should only be used with Billers that have an internal cashier solution. 
To confirm what the Biller has, IM should ask "Do you use Payment Entry or Tyler Cashiering for posting entries into MUNIS?" - If using Payment Entry that indicates no cashier product.
