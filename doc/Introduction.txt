Project Goals
Our primary goal is to modernize our existing .NET applications to leverage the power and flexibility of Kubernetes.  By migrating to .NET 8 and running on Linux nodes in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), we aim to enhance application performance, scalability, and security.  For applications that face technological blockers, we will provide guidelines for running .NET 4.8 on Windows nodes in AKS as an alternative approach.
Scope
This Confluence space covers a wide range of topics, including Kubernetes basics, migration strategies, application modernization, deployment, and developer guides for creating new applications. It is designed to be a resource for software engineers, providing detailed documentation, best practices, and example code snippets to facilitate the migration and development process.
