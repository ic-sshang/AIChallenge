Stratus
M​aryland uses 2 types of Real Estate bills - Annual and Semi annual with warrant bills (Unique bill number) with 1 installment, and then a 2nd bill (Unique bill number) with 2 installments (may need 2 tasks). The first bill if not paid will override the 2nd bill (balance forward).
Maryland Tax integration uses a conveyance file for RE accounts

NOTE: If a Biller wants card readers, SRED is strongly recommended for any Biller without the MUNIS cashier product. 
EMV devices should only be used with Billers that have an internal cashier solution. 
To confirm what the Biller has, IM should ask "Do you use Payment Entry or Tyler Cashiering for posting entries into MUNIS?" - If using Payment Entry that indicates no cashier product.
