page should understand single donation vs multi-donations
	render more like figma for single donations
are the radio buttons yes vs no really needed or can the existing checkbox and amount radio work?
detail text is hidden by default (tell me more) might need to show this
add new agreement text and checkbox for a T&Cs before going to the payment method page
payment method - do we really need the secondary address if it is different than a billing/invoice
	option - there is donation detail record tied to the payment record where we could store a second address if absolutely needed
confirmation page
	is displaying secodary address needed???
summary
	single donations hide inline header for "donations"
recurring payments (should be out of scope)
	work around proposal - tfb will know about contributions paid and they should send a invoice via a integration to process a recurring payment
