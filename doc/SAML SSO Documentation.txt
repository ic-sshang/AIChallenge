The page provides an overview of 
SAML SSO (Security Assertion Markup Language Single Sign-On)
, explaining its role in exchanging identity data between an Identity Provider and a Service Provider. It contrasts 
CloudSSOConnect
 and 
SAML SSO
, highlighting that SAML SSO uses digitally signed XML documents for authentication and authorization. Additionally, it includes an example of 
InvoiceCloud SP-initiated SAML SSO
 to illustrate the process.
What is SAML SSO?
SAML - Security Assertion Markup Language
is a security standard
used to exchange identity data
SAML v2.0 is the most common standard to enable SSO
SAML still uses ICRemoteAuthenticationAPI to complete the SSO (Single Sign-On) Experience
CloudSSOConnect vs. SAML SSO
CloudSSOConnect - emails/passwords are sent to InvoiceCloud and stored so 
WE
 can perform authentication and authorization
SAML SSO - Authentication/Authorization data is sent to InvoiceCloud as a SAML assertion
SAML SSO transfers a user’s identity from the Identity Provider to the Service Provider
Done through exchanging digitally signed XML documents
