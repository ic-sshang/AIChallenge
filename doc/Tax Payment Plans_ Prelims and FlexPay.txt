The Problem
In tax, payers want the ability to schedule payments against an account, parcel, or property prior to the invoice being available. Some tax bills are small but others can be thousands of dollars, so payers want the ability to make payments over time. Tax invoices today are uploaded by the biller a few weeks before the due dates, not months before, so the payer cannot pay over the course of the year.
We’ve made prelim invoices in the past with Marion County to try and solve this use case however it is not an easy or scalable solution. We need to create a systematic way to create prelim invoices. Marion County has used FlexPay to create schedules around these prelims. This entire process for Marion involves making the prelim, matching the prelim invoices to the real invoices, and auto-enrollment process. 
Why: How do we know this is a real problem and worth solving?
Multiple billers (Marion County, James City County, Norfolk, Oceanside, Western VA water authority) have requested this functionality to create payment plans on a tax bill prior to the tax bill being known. Currently, Marion County is using a customized method create prelim invoices and then uses our existing FlexPay product to allow payers to create payment schedules .
Current Marion Process:
Marion County There are 4 upload periods throughout the year.  All requiring their own uplaod process.   Two Installments 
Dec - Jan Install 1 (One Cent Bills) (5 Hour) and Prelims (5 hours) 
Install 1 (One Cent Bills) - 9 large files from the previous upload manually uploaded to the system using a manual custom application.  All bills are set to $.01. 
Prelims - Same large files as the one cent bills, but the balance is set to the spring balances.  This an estimate of what the balances could be in the spring. 
Mar-Apr Install 2 (Replacements) (5 hours) 
Install 1 Type R - New set of 9 files provided by GUTS given to us to load to the system to Replace (R) Install 1 balances and to do auto conveyance. 
Prelims - Are deactivated  
Install 2 Replacements - New set of 9 files provided by GUTS given to us to load to the system for install 2 invoices.   
Move Scheduled Payments - Get all scheduled payments from Install 1 and True Up the Scheduled payments for these invoices. The following Formula is what needs to be done to true up an Invoice: 
Last Remaining Flexpay Balance = Last Remaining Flexpay Balance +(Remaining Flexpay Scheduled payments - Balance due) Note: True ups are such a confusing process and gets us scrambling every time we run this Oct - Nov Install 2 
Run install 2 invoices as type R.  Should be a file provided by Guts.
Another request from some tax billers is to have the concept of escrow, some payers can make payments on a tax bill but the biller only receives the bill when it is paid in full. This program was called “Easy Pay” as part of MCC but it not used very much and only works for some New England billers. 
Revenue Opportunity:
There is a financial incentive to doing this. If we split the total tax bill across multiple payments we can charge multiple service fees. We will also be able to sell more to billers collecting tax payments according to sales. 
Focused on approaching from CIS systems: Low, Devnet, Tyler Munis, Tyler Eagle, Aumentum.
Audience: Who are we building for?
Primarily for tax billers. According to data found in the CRM, we have 294 billers that have an invoice alias mentioning tax. Tax billers who offer something similar to a payment plan now are managing these in excel. Additionally some of these tax biller require that they manage the payment plans configuration themselves, not the payers. Most of these billers are served by QDS, BS&A, and Munis. We can get more billers to IC by also going after other partnerships such as Tyler Eagle, Aumentum and Devnet.  
Prelim and FlexPay - High-level Approach 
There are three events in the existing Prelim and FlexPay process: 
Prelim Creation Process 
Actuals to Prelims
Auto Enrollment Process 
Below outlines the entire workflow from a high level. 
Red indicates were we need more information about what’s happening now and what we want to happen. 
We plan on using a method to create a prelim populated with the tax bill amount from the previous cycle to create a single invoice for payers (this was previously done as customization for Marion County). Once we have created this invoice the payer will use FlexPay to determine the number of payments and frequency.
First, IC would have to automatically create a dummy invoice item a payer can schedule FlexPay against, without an official tax invoice present yet. This amount would be equal to the tax amount from the last year for that payer. If there wasn’t a tax bill from the previous year the payer would not be eligible for the dummy invoice that year, instead they would receive their bill when it is ready. 
Prelim Creation process needs to be defined how this is done. 
Once registered, payers would select “View or Pay Open Invoices,” and their tax bill should appear there along with their other bills.
If they clicked on “Pay Selected” for a tax invoice the next screen would display FlexPay as a payment option.
Next, the payer selects how many payments they want to make on the amount based on the last cycle's tax bill. There is language at the top of the FlexPay schedule creation page that the user will be auto-enrolled in the next tax invoice using the same schedule they create currently. 
The user will receive a FlexPay Confirmation email, confirming that they have registered for FlexPay and includes language that they will be auto-enrolled when the next invoice comes in. 
Once the actual invoices become available for the biller, we move the scheduled payments and payment history from prelim to actual based on the new invoice. We would then adjust the final payment or payments to get the right amount (credit if we overestimated and a larger final payment if we underestimated). To make this work we would need a systematic way to match and replace prelim invoices showing last cycle's tax amount with the actuals. For James City County invoices per customer are matched together by using customerID, invoiceTypeID, billerbillYear, billerInstallmentNumber. 
Need a documented system for moving prelims to actuals.
When the actuals are known the final payment is about to be paid (3 days prior) then a scheduled payment email is sent to the payer letting the payer know about final payment amount. 
The user can cancel their FlexPay schedule at any time once they have created the schedule. If the user cancels the schedule then they will not be auto-enrolled in FlexPay when the new invoice is created. The user will receive a new invoice notification. 
The payer can change the date of a FlexPay payment at any point in the Customer Portal. To change the amount of a payment the payer must reach out to the biller. The biller can move a FlexPay payment date or update an amount at any time in the biller portal. 
When the new invoice is created, then the new invoice auto-enrollment email is sent to the payer. 
The biller can set the time frame of when they want the new auto-enrollment process to happen - hard coded now.
 The email contains the new schedule for the new invoice. The schedule is created based off the payer’s previous schedule using the selected number of payments evenly spaced up until the invoice due date. 
Success
How do we know if we’ve solved this problem?
We will know we succeeded if we can solve the pain points for Marion County and other billers. We will also be able to collect tax payments for multiple types of tax invoices with minimal IC effort. 
We will have solved this problem if we have a seamless onboarding process and can easily self manage the entire FlexPay Auto enrollment process, with limited development effort.  The solution needs to include: 
scalable integration to create prelims across multiple CIS systems 
onboarding for new billers looking to use prelims

Questions/ Things needed from Biller 
1
On Boarding Biller with Payment Plans 
Decision point if we can import any remaining payment plan payments. If we can import any remaining payments these are imported as scheduled payments.
Flexpay is not an option for past due invoices. 
Biller knows Balance Forward is not available, as FlexPay schedules can’t be readjusted. 
Does biller have supplement bills?
As of 2/2/2023 we don’t have a way to support supplements added on a prelim or then a FlexPay schedule made. Biller knows we will ignore supplement bills. 
In CA and will have to recognize this. 
2
Prelim Creation Process 
previous year and maintaining a clear way to tie the previous invoices. 
key for identifying parcel/key at the invoice level 
UX – if people see a zero they won't pay on it. What should be the right experience for prepaying today? Should we show the last amount or not show an amount that we don’t have?
Payers cannot use FlexPay for bills under $100
Payers have a minimum of 6 months to make payments. Biller can pick 2-12.
Payer can only schedule as far as the due date of the tax bill
Multiple tax types included (real estate, property, boat taxes)
When does the biller want prelims made? Can be any date. 
Invoice option in the CRM - 59 - Minimum amount needed to do FlexPay 
Invoice option in the CRM - 36 - Max allowed number of payments 2-12
Invoice option in the CRM - 37 - Allow payments to be scheduled past the due date. Don’t check.

3
Actuals to Prelims
Next step - When the actual invoice amounts are know, we recalculate all remaining payments, not just the final 
Payment history transfers between the two. Payment history is not lost when the dummy invoice is converted to the official invoice. If we deactivate the prelims then the payment history is lost. 
Changes in tax amount once the real invoice is present is automatically reflected on the remaining payments
When will the biller and IC receive actual invoices?
Does the biller want a recalculation of the FlexPay schedules that were made on the prelims to reflect the new actuals amount or do they want the recalculated amount added to the final bill “true up”? 2/2/2023 we only support making true ups at this time.
Does the biller want us to deactivate the prelims or not? If prelims are deactivated then payment history does not show on the actual invoice.

Auto Enrollment Process 
late fees considerations 
need two dates from biller for each installment 
Balance Forward considerations
When does the biller want an Auto-Enrollment date? This date could be either auto-enrolling into a prelim bill or auto-enrolling into the second installment, or simply another invoice of the same invoice type.

FlexPay + Prelim
Authorized Accounts only (payers eligible only can be added)
This could be only biller approved payers can have prelims made and sign up for FlexPay plans. 
4
FlexPay
Readjustment calculation (ie not doing the “true up” at the last payment)​
Do we continue to have a true up? Do we have people that have a huge true up?
Need research into if this is worth it. How much do the prelims (last year’s tax bill) vrs actuals (current year’s bill) actually change? If its a lot that could be harmful to the payer. If not and its a small amount (we suspect this might be for many states) then maybe its not worth a full schedule recalculation. 
5
Prelims
Standard PDF Template for Prelim 
We don’t get a real PDF invoice from the biller when we, IC, makes the prelim invoices. Therefore we need a standard PDF template for prelims that still gives payers information about their tax bill.

Prelims
Require Oldest Invoice to be Paid First 
Some billers want this option especially for tax. 2/2/2023 for example with Allen County tax we did not make prelims for their delinquent payers since they wanted those delinquent payers to pay off their last years tax bill first. 
7
FlexPay
Registration visibility 
Currently very hard to find FlexPay as a user in the customer portal to sign up. We need a better way to sign up and manage registration and FlexPay schedule management if scaling.

Prelims
Accessing Tax Assessor’s file sooner (Allows more accurate amount for prelims earlier, and pushes for services sign up earlier and reduction of billers’ efforts for services sign up)
This is a potential benefit to get more accurate tax information for the current year sooner. 
9
FlexPay
Escrow ability (billers want the bill in full) 
For billers that want to be paid in full (dependent on counties in CA and some counties simply for preference) we don’t have a way to hold FlexPay payments, or any payments made in an escrow state and only send to the biller when the full invoice amount is paid. EasyPay is a company in CA that is offering an escrow concept product to tax billers (may have been some conversations with them by Patty). 
10
FlexPay
Unregistered FlexPay Sign up
Payers would not have to first register to see the dummy invoice and use FlexPay. We would prompt one-time users to either pay the full amount or register to use FlexPay. Once registered, they would select “View or Pay Open Invoices,” and their tax bill should appear there along with their other bills (payers can have both real estate and personal property taxes).
