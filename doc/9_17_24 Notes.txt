 presented:
Design review for components
Items to update:
All buttons need to be the same exact font-size
All buttons that have icons need to have the icons fully interchangeable for any icon to be used in either position (beginning or end) - i.e. no hardcoding icons to a button
Focus should naturally transition from the accordion element to any focusable child elements within the accordion (test this)
Accordion’s focus outline needs to be 2px
Helper text on input should not be a required prop (it will be sparingly used)
All inputs should have a consistent height of 40px
Fix the ‘X’ icon on the modals
Fieldset legends should match the same styling as input labels (font-size and font-weight etc)
 presented:
one button to rule them all 
 
takeaways:
need new icon only button
links will not have icons (need to check about table use cases)
one button with lots of configuration would be harder for new FE devs to work with
We will keep 4 or so button components separate
primary pill buttons will come back to account for landing page, but have a future to go away long-term
  walked through:
file tempaltes:
new one for marketing assets with vector device mockups
new one for slide deck
delete payer template
plain language: what components are impacted?
should we be using “enroll”?
