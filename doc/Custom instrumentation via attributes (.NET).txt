New Relic's .NET agent provides several options for 
custom instrumentation
. Custom instrumentation allows you to instrument parts of your app that are not instrumented automatically. This document describes how to instrument your app by decorating the methods in your app code with attributes.
Use the 
Transaction
 attribute to create a custom transaction. You can also mark the custom transaction as a web transaction with the attribute's 
Web
 property.
Use the 
Trace
 attribute to add custom instrumentation to methods that are invoked within a preexisting transaction.
Requirements include:
.NET agent version 
6.16.178.0
 or higher.
You must be willing to modify your source code. If you cannot or do not want to modify your source code, use 
custom instrumentation via XML
.
Your project must have a reference to 
NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll
 (for example, installing the package and placing 
using NewRelic.Api.Agent;
 in your code). This package is in the 
NuGet gallery
.
The 
Transaction
 and 
Trace
 attributes must be applied to concrete implementations of methods. They cannot be applied on interfaces or super class method definitions.
Transactions called within transactions
Methods decorated with the 
[Transaction]
 attribute will only create a new transaction when one does not already exist. When a method decorated with 
[Transaction]
 is called from 
within
 a previously started transaction, it will be treated as the 
[Trace]
 attribute instead, and will provide more information about the existing transaction.
