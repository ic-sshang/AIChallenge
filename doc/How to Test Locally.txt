 Overview
This document provides step-by-step guidance on how to:
Acquire an authorization token from the 
BillerReportingAPI
.
Use the token to authorize requests in the 
BillerReportingChatAPI
.
Execute test queries on both APIs.
Configure the projects to run in MyIIS.
Update configuration files for local testing.
 Instructions
1. Obtain the Authorization Token
Run the BillerReportingAPI
 locally.
Navigate to the following URL (replace 
{BillerGUID}
 and 
{BillerUserGUID}
 with your own values):
https://localhost:7181/api/v1/token?billerGuid={BillerGUID}&billerLoginGuid={BillerUserGUID}
This endpoint will return a 
Bearer token
, which is required to authorize requests to the 
BillerReportingChatAPI
.
2. Authorize the BillerReportingChatAPI
Run the BillerReportingChatAPI
 locally.
Open Swagger UI, typically at:
https://localhost:7074/swagger/index.html
Locate the 
Authorize
 button (or Authorization field) in Swagger.
Paste the token obtained from the BillerReportingAPI into the 
Bearer
 token field in the format.
Once authorized, you can use the 
/api/v1/queries
 endpoint to test queries on the 
BillerReportingChatAPI
.
3. Execute Queries in the BillerReportingAPI
Go to the GraphQL UI for the BillerReportingAPI, typically at:
https://localhost:7181/graphql/ui/
Paste the token acquired above in the connection settings
Paste your GraphQL query into the request section.
Important
: If you have any extra symbols (e.g., colons or parentheses) that are not part of valid GraphQL syntax, remove them before sending the request.
4. Running in MyIIS
If you need to run these services under MyIIS, update the relevant URLs in the 
web.config
 file within the 
BillerPortal
 project:
<add key="BillerAIReportingAPIUrl" value="https://localhost:7181/graphql" />
<add key="BillerAIReportingChatAPIUrl" value="https://localhost:7074/api/v1/queries" />
Going to the BillerPortal > Reports > AI Report Generator. You can search your query and step through the BillerReportingChatAPI and the BillerReportingAPI.
Important Notes:
In BillerReportingChatAPI, make sure to change the API URL of the graphql to your localhost in the appsettings.Development.config
"GraphQl": {
  "ApiUrl": "https://localhost:7181" // this one
},
FAQ:
How does the API know what BillerID to use?
One of the claims in the token is the billerguid. 
Summary
By following these steps—acquiring the token from the 
BillerReportingAPI
, authorizing the 
BillerReportingChatAPI
 in Swagger, executing GraphQL queries, and updating the configuration files as needed—you can effectively test both services in your local or IIS environment.
If you encounter any issues or have additional questions, please consult your development team or reference the existing documentation for further troubleshooting steps.
