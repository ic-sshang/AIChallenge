How PMs Should Use This Library
Treat these hypotheses like a 
scavenger hunt list
—not as facts, but as prompts for what to notice.
Mark “Confirmed,” “Disconfirmed,” or “New” during observation.
New surprises are the gold. If you see something not on this list, 
lean in hard
—that’s where competitive advantage lives.
