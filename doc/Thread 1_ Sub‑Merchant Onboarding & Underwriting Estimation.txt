Sub‑Merchant Onboarding & Underwriting
Level of Effort Assumption
Level of Effort (LOE) estimates
 represent the approximate duration required to complete work, based on a typical delivery team of 3–4 resources. These estimates assume that teams can execute the work without external dependencies or constraints.
With a typical team size, the estimated level of effort is:
X-Small
 – Approximately 
0.5 month
Small
 – Approximately 
1 month
Medium
 – Approximately 
2 months
Large
 – Approximately 
3 months
X-Large
 – Approximately 
6 months
Medium Rock
Business Intent / Outcome
Alpha (1–3 billers)
Beta (~20 billers)
GA (Scale)
Dependencies
Blockers / Open Qs
Salesforce → CRM Handoff
Ensure clean, timely “ready‑to‑board” biller data reaches CRM so onboarding/KYC has a single source of truth; avoid re‑keying.
