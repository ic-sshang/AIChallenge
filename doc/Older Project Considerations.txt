Both 
CRM
 and 
MyIIS
 fall into this category.  It is important to take special care with these projects as they are an old visual studio project type 
website
.   Not the more modern 
Web Application
 type of project.  Because of this, certain challenges exist that do not exist in other projects.  In particular, satellite assemblies stored in the 
/bin
 folder are included in source control.  This is because it doesn’t use nuget packages in the traditional sense.  So as a result, these files stored in bin folder are used.  They are only updated when necessary and special care must be taken when merging a pull request to ensure they are only overwritten when absolutely necessary.
