Building a Guide
When should I use a Pendo Guide? 
Pendo guides can be used on virtual site or the customer portal. This is a payer facing application. When there is a request from a biller for a change on the payer site that IC’s existing tooling cannot already support then Pendo possibly can be used.
Who can build a payer site Pendo Guides? 
ONLY product team members 
 , 
 , and 
 can build payer site Pendo guides.  
How to request building a guide? 
For Non Product
: Requests for a Pendo flow should still be done through the existing product intake process. It will then be product’s decision if a Pendo solution can be made. 
For Product Team:
 Reach out to Shelby via email with request. Please look at guide list below to see if there is one already created that could work for your use case.

Search Results Support 
Product
As a payer I want help when searching for an invoice. 
Not made yet
The purpose of this flow is to help users gather the information needed to find their invoice, enter the information in the search fields correctly, ultimately help users find their invoice and help troubleshoot when they can’t find their invoice. There could be several flow versions for this use case.
Storing Saved Payment Message
Product
As a payer on one time payment route for a Mclogin account I want to know how to store a payment method. 
Not made yet
For Mclogin accounts there is no way to store a saved payment method and therefore sign up for AutoPay on the one time payment route. There is also no way to sign up for Pay by text. The user would first have to register to save the store payment method. We want to add guidance to the user they first must register to do these actions. 
Generic Customizable Text
Product
As a biller I want to add custom text in areas IC doesn’t have this.
Not made yet
This flow should be generic to use on several different pages. There may need to be different versions of this particular guide to accommodate for the different pages and messaging needed. 
Attention / Alert Messaging 
Product
As a biller I want to add alert messaging so payers are aware of alerts, or actions they must do. 
Not made yet
Example of this flow is already made with Collier County. The purpose of this flow is for billers requesting messaging that they require their payers to see as an alert or attention to do a certain action.
Feedback Widget 
Product UX
As a payer I want to provide feedback on my payment experience in the one time payment route and in the customer portal. 
Complete
This flow would be to gather feedback and ultimately NPS on the payer site. We will need to research Pendo NPS capabilities and how to implement this to result in feedback on the payment experience. 
New Payer Registration 
Product
As a new payer registering I want an intro guide to my new customer portal. 
Not made yet
This flow could be available for new payers registering and possibly for new billers going live. The flow would be an intro guide for payers registering and entering the customer portal for the first time.
