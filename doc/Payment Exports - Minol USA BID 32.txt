This Biller has their own repository that holds their export logic. This page is meant to review what triggers the export, how the export is generated, and how you can create the export in the scenario it’s needed.
Trigger:
As of 10/07/2024, what triggers this export is held in Automate Schedule (Skybot). The name of the job is “MinolPaymentFileFTP-AZURE” and is triggered at 20:59:00 every day.
The following file is an example job log: 
 
 
Creation of Export:
The repository that holds the logic is named “MinolPaymentFileFTP-AZURE“ as seen below from the Azure DevOps snippet.
For starters, the settled batches are identified through the stored procedure “selSettledBatches” which returns all settled batches for the Biller with the given constraint of the “PaymentTypeID”.
How we filter down the settled batches to the one we want to use to create the export is by simply using the condition of the “SettledDate” being greater or equal to the “RUNDATE”.
The “RUNDATE” is set through the following function “setRunDate” which as seen in the picture, sets it to be the previous day at 9:00:00 PM.
 Keeping that in mind, we can determine the settled batch by using the following query where we use the date that the file was expected to export and the previous day in it. In the example query you see we use 04/03/2024 as the date the file was expected and 04/02/2024 as the previous date. The 21:00:00.000 hour is set by the setRunDate() function and the 20:59:00.000 comes from the time the jobs are usually triggered.

SELECT distinct sb.* FROM SettledBatches sb
inner join payments as p on p.settledbatchid = sb.settledbatchid
inner join invoices as i on i.invoiceid = p.invoiceid
WHERE 
i.invoicetypeid = 0 -- type invoice
and sb.SettledDate BETWEEN '2025-09-08 21:00:00.000' AND '2025-09-09 20:59:00.000'
--and sb.paymenttypeid = 1 -- cc
--and sb.paymenttypeid = 2 -- ach

-- SELECT * FROM SettledBatches WHERE SettledDate BETWEEN 'Previous Day' AND 'File Expected Day'
The output for that query is seen in the picture below. You can identify two records where one is for PaymentTypeID 1 (CC) and the other for PaymentTypeID 2 (ACH).
This repository generates an export for each PaymentTypeID so please establish the needed export with CS.
Now that we have the settled batch(es), we now get into the usage of the “selMinolBatchDetail” stored procedure which is executed per each settled batch. 
The stored procedure has the added parameter “SettledBatchID” which we can identify through the table snippet above.
 The stored procedure [selMinolBatchDetail] only has the logic used below which is quite simple:

select
	P.PaymentAmount
	,P.PaymentDate
	--,I.InvoiceDate
	,P.PaymentDate as InvoiceDate
	--,C.AccountNumber
	,left(P.InvoiceNumber,15) as AccountNumber
from Payments P 
	--inner join Invoices I  on P.InvoiceID=I.InvoiceID
	--inner join Customers C  on P.CustomerID=C.CustomerID
where
	P.SettledBatchID=@SettledBatchID
	and P.TransactionTypeID=1
	and P.BillerID=32
We can replace the “
@SettledBatchID
" with the “SettledBatchID” for our scenario which could be “2251463” if we are targeting PaymentTypeID 2 (ACH).
Once we run the query, it results in the following output table. We can save the results as a CSV file.
 To the file, please add a top row containing the title columns: 
wide
760
PaymentAmount,PaymentDate,InvoiceDate,AccountNumber
Example file:  
 
Once you’ve created the CSV file, you can download the following program: 
 
That program is a copy of the logic in the original repository. The only changes needed to be made in the program is the path for the folder containing the file and the file name. The output file will be generated and placed in the same folder. Feel free to rename the file to hold the appropriate date of when the export should have run.
 Example output file: 
 
File naming rule
Name the file as:
<ExportDate><Type>.ASC
Where:
<ExportDate>
 = the day of export (e.g., 
YYYYMMDD
).
<Type>
 = 
IC
 for Credit Card (
PaymentTypeID = 1
) or 
IA
 for ACH (
PaymentTypeID = 2
).
Examples (Sept 10, 2025):
20250910IC.ASC
 → credit card
20250910IA.ASC
 → ACH
Please revise the file generated and confirm with CS that the file you generated is the one the Biller was missing.
