The purpose of this weekly meeting is to review open JIRAS:
 
What is an alignment meeting and what it is not?
It is a meeting where the IM/PM team member has an open Jira and needs additional information, escalate it, or offer clarification.
After an issue is discussed during an alignment call, a clear path for resolution including deliverables and dates, is set.
An alignment call is not a status call where the IM/PM/PM team member offers updates to the attendees.
Assumptions:
If a JIRA is open, it has the latest updates, so the IM/PM team does not need to ask for status.
Every JIRA has a delivery date. The date is entered after triage and after the developer and the manager review deliverables.
Since all JIRAs will have a delivery date and updates close to realtime, the need for Alignment meetings will be reduced.
Since IMs, and PMs will have reviewed the JIRAs before the alignment meeting, the issues will be clearly understood. The “Ask” for engineering should be 100% clear and spelled out in the JIRA.  The explanations should be so clear that no further explanations during the meeting should be required.  The meeting will be used only to answer questions engineering may have and to obtain from them an update and an estimated delivery date.
Engineering will have reviewed the JIRAs before the meeting.
