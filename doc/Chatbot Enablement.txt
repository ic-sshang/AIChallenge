Technical
Has the code been accepted into our codebase?
Per Karthic: The code is present in IVRTG's SCM (GitLab).
Do we need to spin up specific infrastructure to run on?
Per Karthic:
Dev: IVRTG has spun up a Kubernetes cluster where the code will be deployed.
Staging: IVRTG is in the process of spinning up a Kubernetes cluster in Azure where the code will be deployed.
Prod: The IC Kubernetes cluster will be used to deploy the application for prod workloads. IVRTG team working on gaining access to the IC cluster.
What external services are we dependent on and have they been vetted?
Per Karthic:
Azure (already vetted and utilized today)
Azure Kubernetes Service
Azure OpenAI
Azure Database for PostgreSQL
Pinecone Vector DB (Azure Marketplace)
MinIO Object Storage (community version AGPLv3 used within Kubernetes cluster for image storage)
OpenTelemetry (for logging and observability)
Do we have a way of monitoring availability and performance (latency, failed interactions, etc)?
Per Karthic:
PostgreSQL store
ConversationsDB: Chat sessions between users and agents
FeedbackDB: User feedback on conversations, agents or messages
GenerationLogDB: Detailed logging of AI generation metrics and performance
OpenTelemetry (can be piped to NewRelic)
Logging
Distributed tracing
How will we package and support the dev integration instructions?
Per Karthic:
We will provide the following JS to billers to embed on their site: 
<!-- Chat Widget Container -->
<div id="ic-payments-agent-widget" class="chat-widget-container">
<!-- The widget will be inserted here by the script -->
</div>

<!-- JavaScript to embed and load the frontend -->
<script src="<%= apiBaseUrl %>/api/widget/widget.js?auth_token=<%= authToken %>"></script>
Associated CSS which can be added to the stylesheet or inline: 
/* Chat Widget Container */
.chat-widget-container {
    position: fixed;
    bottom: 20px;
    right: 20px;
    z-index: 1000;
}
The 
apiBaseUrl
 will be the domain that is hosting this application.
The 
authToken
 will be generated by IVRTG team as part of onboarding the biller for the payer AI agent
BillerDB
 in PostgreSQL store contains branding, configuration and allowed domains. Future enhancement planned to move this to IVRTG store where biller configuration resides for IVRs and eventually to read directly from IC CRM.

Who will coordinate with the Training team to build content for this?
Other
How will we communicate the availability of this new feature (Mkt overlap with overall AI launch)?
What are the costs associated and what does our pricing model look like?
We have them, Dennis will work on updating the pricing model
How can we report on usage and adoption?
Karthic? yes, we have it, can pull it manually, Dennis to work on queries
