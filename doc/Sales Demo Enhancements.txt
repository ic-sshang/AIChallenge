The Problem
Our salespeople cannot give demos that demonstrate the full capabilities of the IC platform without support from Dev or other outside resources. As a result, multiple teams in the organization have to work to create a demo and sales must wait for this. Creating demos is also complex and time consuming for salespeople, adding to the time they take to prepare. 
https://invoicecloud.atlassian.net/browse/EBPP-1576
 
Why: How do we know this is a real problem and worth solving?
There are a multitude of common issues and questions that add time and inefficiency to the current demo process. They include:
I am unable to show clients email/text history for payers 
I always forget to turn on FlexPay, where was it again? 
Where do I configure Service Fees, need a lower % set 
Why does my report not show data? 
I am not able to demo one click pay to my prospect
Whenever a salesperson needs to do a demo SSO for insurance customers they have to work with dev to create the demo
Additionally, for an experienced Salesperson, it takes 1.5 hours to re-stage, customize virtual site/customer portal with biller specific branding. These changes can take up to 45 mins to appear. This assumes all the images have already been re-sized, background removed which takes another 20 mins using LunaPic. 
For a new sales person the process would take 2-2.5 hours.
Audience: Who are we building for?
Our internal sales and solutions team or any other team that needs to prepare demos for prospective billers or current billers. 
High-level Approach
We have a list from the sales and solution team of enhancements they would like to see ordered by priority. We can further prioritize and segment these throughout 2021 (we do not need to do a big release).

As a salesperson doing a demo, I would like to upload biller, invoice and email images for a customer for all invoice types in CRM/Utilities, and have system resize each image based on default values, and remove transparency for an image, so I don't have to spend 20 mins for each demo (might do 3 demos a day) using 3rd party image manipulation tools
 
Cloud Store
2
