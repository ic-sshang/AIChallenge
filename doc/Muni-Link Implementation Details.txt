Rules of Engagement
If the biller is already in production with Muni-Link reach out to Alex Dionis 
adionis@muni-link.com
If biller is in implementation phase with Muni Link reach out to Tim Ginger McCarthy 
gmccarthy@muni-link.com

Configuration
IMPORTANT- All Muni-Link Billers require customer portal authentication type: USERNAME WITH PASSWORD:
Virtual Site
Optional per biller.  Recommend Account Number and Last Name
Invoice Types
Integration will use InvoiceTypeIDs 100-157
InvoiceCloud’s InvoiceTypeIDs will correspond to the Muni-Link BillingGroupIDs. 
NOTE: Muni-Link will send the BillingGroupID value in the BIF and InvoiceCloud will alter/map the value to the applicable InvoiceTypeID (add 100 to BillingGroupID value to get the InvoiceTypeID). 
See examples.
Billers will use the BillingGroupID’s differently in Muni-Link. Billers can configure BillingGroupIDs to contain different accounts or different changes.
 See examples.
The configuration of InvoiceTypeIDs to BillingGroupIDs allows for configuration of the name of the invoice type, deposits and balance forwarding.
NOTE: The Invoice Types need to be set and configured with the Biller before the go live date and it needs to be communicated with the biller that they cannot add / remove Billing Group IDs without the assistance of InvoiceCloud. 
Example 1: 
BillingGroupIDs for Accounts
Billing group contains water and sewer accounts (1 total billing group with BillingGroupID=2)
BillingGroupID = 2 (water and sewer) maps to InvoiceTypeID = 102
A value of 100 will be added to the Billing Group ID in Muni-Link so that their BillingGroupID = 1 maps to InvoiceTypeID = 101. A BillingGroupID = 2 maps to InvoiceTypeID = 102.
Example 2: 
BillingGroupIDs for Charges
Billing groups are separate for water and sewer (2 total billing groups)
BillingGroupID = 4 (water) maps to InvoiceTypeID = 104
BillingGroupID = 5 (sewer) maps to InvoiceTypeID = 105
A value of 100 will be added to the Billing Group ID in Muni-Link so that their BillingGroupID = 1 maps to InvoiceTypeID = 101. A BillingGroupID = 2 maps to InvoiceTypeID = 102.

Bill Presentment
Muni-Link or Billers
Project Start
If biller prints in house IC will integrate to Muni-Link PDF linking.  Any other Bill Presentment will need to be integrated between IC and Biller or Bill Print Vendor.  Ask the biller if they are doing their printing in house.
Coding Requirements - Integrations 360
Advanced Settings
Edit Advanced Settings to fill in the missing data in the square brackets using values in the excel spreadsheet provided by Muni-Link for the specific biller. IC Integrations will input values like the ones below for the IM to update:
The following values will not change and will be set by IC Integrations and will not need to be updated:
Muni-Link Value
IC Advanced Setting

Using the implementation spreadsheet provided by Muni-Link, we can plug in these missing values. These values must be populated for the TEST and PROD portals. The examples below are from the TEST environment:

Common Errors/Situations
Anyone using SSO that does not go directly through our portal, does not need Customer Experience training… it will not match us w/ the user experience (specifically for Muni-Link).
If Muni-Link is not ready to train/demo, IC can do a basic walkthrough -
