The purpose of the Biller File Troubleshooting page in the CRM is to allow IC employees to test sample files for billers and see a detailed description of any issues that would come up during the file loading process.
The Biller File Troubleshooting page will have two distinct user paths: uploading a file for validation and viewing validation results.
Requirements
Ability to upload a file for validation 
Choose a biller, file type (Invoices/Adjustments/Payments/Misc), conversion type, and file
Ability to search for uploaded files by biller
Show historical files
Show in-progress files
View the conversion and validation logs for each file
Download the logs for a file in an Excel file
Validating a File (Tentative)
User navigates to the Biller File Troubleshooting page in the CRM
Click “Validate File” button, which opens a pop-up window
Select a biller, a file type (invoices/adjustments/payments/misc), and a conversion type
Select a file
Click Upload
The file will be dropped on an App Server for processing
The StratusFileProcessor-Validation job will be kicked off
The conversion and validation results will be stored in the database
Viewing Validation Results (Tentative)
User navigates to the 
Biller File Troubleshooting
 page in the CRM under Tools → Testing Tools
Below the “Validate File” button, there is a field to choose a biller, and a Search button
Choose a biller and click Search
A table will appear with all the validation results for that biller
We need to display the following data: File Name, Timestamp, File Type, File Format, Conversion Results (Pass/Fail), and Validation Results (Pass/Fail)
We should also present a button to download the results in an Excel file
Each entry in the table can be expanded to show the first 5 conversion results and the first 5 validation results, side by side
