Random Thoughts/Music Request
Validate 
all 
requirements for data conversions before creating the INT items (valid files, existing accounts, etc.)
***Check the validity of the files for data conversions 
before
 doing the test import***
Create new Jira action for data conversions?
Have a better understanding of integration requests to skip potential overwhelming mapping information
Leverage Copilot to improve our coding practices (refactoring legacy code, adhering to SOLID principles, code review and analysis)
Underestimating story points for internal items +1
Overestimating internal item capacity when team members are out of office 
Holiday days affect this -I know this! 
 
Follow SOLID principles when writing new code
Learning new things 
 
Learning old things
Assign no-code ITGs (i.e. platform conversions) to whoever will be on call during the due date
