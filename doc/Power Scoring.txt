Notes from June 20 call
We may have other cuts for Integrations or Go Live - the above is Product Engineering-focused.
Time to Value: We changed this to be a Selection, not Scoring, criteria.
Other Benefits drivers:
Urgency of time to market: intended to differentiate between table stakes vs. not being pulled by demand. 
Cost Savings: Products on the mature end of scale are honing product strategy less to revenue, more to cost savings.
Cost drivers
Ease of development: 5 is good (not level of effort-style getting people confused). Is this better than integration effort + engineering effort?
Execution Steps: 
PM uses a lean canvas to conduct power score prioritization 
Each PM submits prioritized product concepts to PM LT for portfolio prioritization
PM LT conducts portfolio Power Score prioritization of concepts for financial business cases
