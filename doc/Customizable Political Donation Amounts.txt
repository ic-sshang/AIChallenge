At a Glance 
To support greater flexibility in political donation workflows, we implemented enhancements allowing payers to customize their contribution amounts for PAC donations in the one-time payment route. These changes introduced configurable options—
custom
 amounts—along with 
minimum and maximum value validations
 to ensure compliance and usability. The updates were necessary to meet specific biller requests for more dynamic donation handling, particularly from 
The Doctors Company (BID: 4389).
 The work was tracked under Jira tickets 
EBPP-27263
 and 
EBPP-27289
, with subtasks ranging from UI updates to validation logic. We collaborated closely with team SPAM, who owns the repositories impacted by these changes, and coordinated testing across both CRM and payment interfaces to ensure seamless integration.
Problem
The enhancements were driven by feedback from 
The Doctors Company (BID: 4389)
 who requested more flexibility in how payers contribute to PAC donations since we previously only supported fix amounts. Their primary complaint was the 
lack of customization
 in the one-time payment flow, where donors were previously restricted to fixed or pre-suggested amounts. This limitation hindered donor engagement and reduced the likelihood of higher contributions.
To address this, we introduced a 
custom amount option
 with configurable 
minimum and maximum thresholds
, allowing payers to enter their own donation amounts while still respecting biller-defined constraints. This change was implemented across both the CRM and the MyIIS payment flow, ensuring consistency and control.
Solution
MYIIS
To support customizable PAC donation amounts, we implemented a multi-layered solution across both the 
CRM configuration interface
 and the 
payer-facing MyIIS application
. The solution required updates to backend validation logic, frontend UI components, and platform configuration settings.

, and 
CustomAmt
 values.
PACValidations.vb
: Introduced a new validation class with methods like:
VisualBasic
Public Function IsValidSuggestedAmount(suggestedAmount As Decimal, minimumAmount As Decimal, maximumAmount As Decimal) As Boolean
    Return suggestedAmount >= Math.Max(minimumAmount, 1D) AndAlso suggestedAmount <= If(maximumAmount = 0D, Decimal.MaxValue, maximumAmount)
End Function


Validation Scenarios
:
Suggested amount must be ≥ $1.00
Minimum must be ≥ $1.00
Maximum must be ≥ $0.00 or omitted (0.00)
Suggested must fall between min and max
