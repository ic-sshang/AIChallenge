Open Questions / Decisions / Blockers
Salesforce → CRM handoff
Creation of “Ready-to-Board” biller records; MoSCoW: 
Should
.
🟢 Ops manually uploads CSV into CRM; data keyed by onboarding team; audit trail via CRM notes.
🟡 Automated one-way sync from Salesforce to CRM; error queue for failures; reduces re-keying.

Must
.
🟢 Ops collects data via Excel/secure email; re-keys into CRM; supporting docs stored manually.

🔴 API integration (Chase or CertiG) to validate in real time; re-verification triggered on bank change.
🔴 Open-banking APIs to monitor ongoing account health and NSF risk.
Blocker:
 Vendor choice (Chase vs CertiG) pending. 
Next Step:

Must
.
🟢 Ops runs KYC/OFAC manually via vendor portal; evidence uploaded to CRM.

KYC Failure Handling
Queues, SLA timers, comms, remediation; not explicitly MoSCoW’d.
🟢 Failures managed manually; Ops declines in CRM; sub-merchant prevented from activation.
🟡 SLA-driven queue in CRM; automated email templates to billers.
🔴 Self-service remediation portal; automated resubmission flows.
Blocker:
 Decline notification templates undefined. 
Next Step:
 Compliance draft comms.
Chase Screening API (C1/C3)
Required Chase approval before processing; MoSCoW: 
Must
.
🔴 Minimal adapter calls Chase API to create merchant + poll status; approval captured in CRM.
🟡 Enhanced adapter w/ retries, better error mapping; Ops dashboard for Chase status.
🔴 Event-driven/webhook architecture to remove polling; auto-retry logic.
Blocker: Sandbox credentials not available from Chase. Next Step: Chase to provision.
Sub-merchant Hierarchy & 1099
Define 
hierarchy data model
 for Parent Biller → Sub-merchants → Entity Types. 
Impacts onboarding, KYC, Chase screening, funding templates, pricing, reporting, and enables IRS 1099-K compliance. 
Also foundational for future 
super-biller expansion
 (multi-entity rollups, consolidated reporting, and settlements).
MoSCoW: 
Must
.
🟡 Capture Parent/Sub, MCC, and TIN in CRM; manual 1099 support.
🟡 Support multi-TIN billers in CRM; consolidated vs entity-level reporting; 
integrate with Ops funding templates.
🔴 Automated 1099-K generation & IRS filing;
Risk segmentation across entities; 
Super-biller roll-up reporting and consolidated settlements.
Blocker: Confirm data model (Merchant vs Sub-Merchant vs EntityType).
 
Next Step:
 Cross-team (Eng + Finance + Ops) session to finalize. 
Note:
 May need to 
future-proof hierarchy
 for 
super-billers
 - Roopa to work with Product to define.
PayPal / Amex Boarding
Establish process for onboarding to 
non-Chase rails
 (PayPal, Amex). Day-1 scope = placeholders + Ops runbook; full API orchestration deferred. Recognized as 
Should Have
.
🟢 Document Ops runbook; capture placeholder config in CRM (e.g., merchant IDs, account settings).
—
Blocker:
 Data elements to send to PayPal/Amex (e.g., merchant order ID) not captured in workflow. 
Next Step:
 Product/Payments Eng to confirm with Chase + PayPal/Amex requirements. 
Note:
 Amex OptBlue migration not feasible by Day-1 — to be phased.
Funding Config UI
UI for Ops to configure 
payout rules, fee debit accounts, reserves/chargeback routing, and sweep cadence
, with full audit logs. Ensures funds are routed correctly and supports Treasury/GL mapping. Marked as 
Must
 because no biller can be activated without it. MoSCoW: 
Must
.
🔴 Minimal CRM screen for Ops to enter payout/fee config; every change logged; config feeds funding jobs.
🟡 Add approval workflows, validations for errors (e.g., duplicate accounts).
🔴 Biller self-service UI with approval gating.
Blocker:
 Decision: CRM vs Portal location unresolved. 
Next Step:
 Product/Eng to decide.
Pricing Flags (CRM → Billing)
Capture 
who pays fees
 (submitter, biller absorbed, or mixed) and sync to billing for accurate statements. Also the basis for future premium pricing (e.g., fast funding). MoSCoW: 
Should
.
🟡 Capture basic flags\toggles in CRM; sync to billing; test statements reconcile.
🟡 Expand to include settlement cadence flags (fast vs. slow) and ensure sync into billing.
🔴 Advanced pricing matrices, tiering, revenue optimization. (e.g., fast funding premium); advanced reconciliation.
Blocker:
 Finance/Ops must define golden test billers to validate billing sync. 
Next Step:
 Align Finance + Eng on minimal Day-1 pricing catalog.
Monthly OFAC Rescreen
Regulatory obligation to rescreen all live billers against OFAC sanctions. Ensures ongoing compliance.
Batch re-screening; MoSCoW: 
Must
.
🟢 Ops manually runs OFAC rescreen with vendor; 
uploads results (PDF/CSV) into CRM
 as audit evidence.
🟡 Scheduled batch job runs automatically; results logged in CRM; tasks created for Ops review.
🔴 Risk-tiered cadence (e.g., high-risk weekly, low-risk monthly) with near-real-time feeds and automated audit log retention.
Open Q:
 How long must evidence be retained? 
Blocker:
 No agreed UI today for uploads; 
MVP assumes Ops attaches vendor output manually.
Annual / Periodic re-KYC
Annual re-KYC reminders; MoSCoW: 
Must
.
🟢 Manual ticklers in CRM; Ops runs re-KYC with vendor manually.
—
🔴 Portal automates reminders, collects new docs, supports self-serve.
Next Step:
 Compliance define cadence by risk tier.
Biller Offboarding
Deactivation in CRM + Chase sync; MoSCoW: 
Must
.
🟢 Ops manually deactivates; CRM syncs status to Chase; processing blocked.
🟡 Notifications triggered; partial suspend/reactivate supported.
🔴 Full lifecycle automation: suspend, reactivate, terminate, notify biller + Chase.
Blocker:
 Must confirm Chase notification requirements.
Next Step:
 Ask Chase integration team.
POS Terminal Activation
Explicitly out of Day-1 scope.
—
—
🔴 Full device lifecycle mgmt (tokenization, firmware updates).
Blocker:
 Need Bluefin/Chase confirmation on terminal boarding.
B) Estimation Blockers vs Assumptions
With the assumptions below, there are no blockers to estimate Day‑1 for Thread 1.
 
Migration sizing is gated only by the re‑KYC policy decision for existing billers.
Potential blockers for estimation
Data model dependency:
 We need to confirm whether 
Merchant / SubMerchant / EntityType
 are distinct objects, and how they relate.
Wizard UX complexity:
 If billers can add multiple entity types, the form logic gets more complex (repeatable sections, validation, rules for linking).
KYC/Screening impact:
 Each entity type may need separate 
KYC checks, bank verification, and Chase screening requests
.
Funding template impact:
 Multiple entity types under one biller may mean 
different payout accounts
 and pricing rules per entity.
Requiring 
Portal self‑serve funding
 in D1 instead of Ops‑only in CRM.
Re‑KYC policy for existing billers
 mandated pre‑migration (affects migration program sizing, not D1 onboarding feature estimates).
