Overview
Problem Statement
As our development processes evolve, the limitations of classic pipelines have become more apparent. Classic pipelines often lack the flexibility, scalability, and version control capabilities required for modern DevOps practices. This has led to inefficiencies, increased maintenance overhead, and difficulties in managing complex workflows.
To address these challenges, we are transitioning to YAML pipelines, which offer:
Enhanced configurability
Better integration with version control systems
Improved automation capabilities
Currently, we have a mix of applications using both classic and YAML pipelines. To maintain consistency and leverage the latest templates, we aim to migrate all classic pipelines to YAML. This transition will ensure uniformity across our CI/CD processes and enable us to fully utilize the benefits of YAML pipelines.

Support Process
How to Request Support
Initial Support Request:
Create a
 Service Ticket 
with:
Detailed description of your issue
Relevant logs, screenshots, and error messages
Environment information
Priority level and impact assessment
For Urgent Issues:
Create a service ticket as described above
Ping the following Slack groups:
platform-support
Requesting New Infrastructure
When your application requires new infrastructure components:
Submit a detailed
 Infra request
 including:
Type of resource needed (MI, repository, etc.)
Application details
Timeline requirements
Business justification
Manager Approvals if needed
Important notes:
Provide advance notice (minimum 1 sprint cycle)
Include clear requirements documentation
The Platform team will incorporate your request into sprint planning
Access Management
Development teams do not have direct access to configure SonarQube gates and policies
The Platform team manages these configurations on behalf of development teams for now
Request changes through the standard support process outlined above
Implementation Decision
We currently maintain a hybrid approach where the Platform Team provides hands-on support while we resolve issues preventing a full self-service model. This approach ensures successful migrations while we build toward greater automation and self-service capabilities.
