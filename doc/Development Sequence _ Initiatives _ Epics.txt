Automate Biller Chase Onboarding using new Chase platform capabilities
Eng Note- Needs ability to create accounts on demand for testing.  Value outside this project as well.
Payment APIs switch from Orbital to new Chase platform
Eng Note- We want to be able to run transactions that can then show up in the next pieces below.
Integrate to new Chase bank account for credits/funding
Eng Note- Need ability to pull line item data/balances from bank account
Biller payout process using new Chase bank account
Eng Note- Leverage our new bank integration to send files for payment
Integrate to new Chase bank account for debits (separate account) (rejects, chargebacks)
Eng Note- Need ability to pull line item data/balances from bank account
Chase reconciliation report integrations (daily file that includes payments settled, etc)
Eng Note- In preparation of sending payments to new platform we need to integrate to the files that will tell us what payments will be in those files
ACH processing changes to accommodate daily NACHA file requirement
Eng Note- Individual ACH transactions will not go through to Chase.  We will bundle them and create a NACHA file end of day.
Updating void/credits logic to support us being payfac
Eng Note- Fill out the integration with the other transaction types
Biller Portal report updates to reflect new model
Finance needs for daily reconciliation process
Biller migration process (ensure bank accounts IC has match Chase, etc)
Eng Note - Follow similar process to OBD/Cass migration where we got the banks that MC/Fiserv had, trued up our system to have those banks, and built out a way to toggle Billers to use new integration vs old integration.
