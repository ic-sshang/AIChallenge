To access our FTP directories, and see the folder setup for our billers, first you will need to log in to one of our terms in RDC.
Once logged in, go to File Explorer, and right click
 “This PC“
 on the sidebar.
Then, click on 
“Add a network Location“
.
Once the 
“Add Network Location Wizard”
 appears, click on Next until the page below is reached.
On the page, paste the text below under the 
“Internet or network address:“
 textbox, and click Next.
\\icwebsftppremium.file.core.windows.net\icftproot
You will be prompted to enter network credentials. At this step, ask a fellow Dev Support/SRE member for the credentials.
Once the credentials have been inputted, continue by clicking Next and Finish.
You now have access to the FTP Directories for our billers!
If you cannot find the biller that you are looking for, make sure to check in the CRM to see if the biller is set up for FTP. 
To find a biller's FTP settings, go to the FTP Management page found in the sidebar.
Once in the page, there should be a path/s set up if the biller is set up for FTP. Below are example paths from one of our test BIDs that is set up for FTP.
