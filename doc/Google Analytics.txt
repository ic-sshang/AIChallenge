When possible, try to use built in Google Analytics events: 
https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gtagjs/events#default_google_analytics_events
 
Current Implementation:
Add new script to page requiring analytics
Listen to Javascript event that can capture a corresponding GA action
Send Google Analytics event with appropriate event parameters
 
POC Branch:

Further research:
Category/Action Amount Limits
Server-side tagging: May require Google Analytics 4
Track sequences of events: possibly no code needed and can be done through reporting (
