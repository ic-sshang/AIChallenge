Random Thoughts/Music Request
Size SPIKES slightly larger to accommodate unknowns?
We had a lot of spikes this sprint and didn’t finish all of them
Have discussion over the research with team
Discuss roadmap with the team before committing to things
If there’s any known preceding work that  is a part of an item/spike, maybe we should get it started while grooming?
e.g items where we’re working with another team or need some kind of report. 
don’t have anything to put here this sprint
being nice to AI
using AI - when in doubt, ask copilot
“when in doubt, ask copilot” > “when in doubt, google” > “when in doubt stack overflow” > “when in doubt, cry”
