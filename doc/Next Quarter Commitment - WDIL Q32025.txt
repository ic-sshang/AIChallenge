Note
: In Q3, the team will roll off four contractor resources—two developers and two SDETs. While the developers had limited impact, the team will absorb automation responsibilities previously handled by the SDETs. This aligns with our desired engineering culture, where all developers contribute to both feature work and automated testing.
With reduced staffing, velocity is expected to drop. Based on historical velocity we projected ~140 points for the quarter post-vacations. We are committing to 119 points—a stretch, especially given the team’s go-live-driven workload and risk of unplanned work.
To mitigate delivery risk, we recommend adding one additional resource (developer or SDET) to help stabilize capacity and maintain quality automation.

Helper Text on ACH payments
City of Boston, Kitsap County, VA Water

Client Escalation List #16
Boston wanted IC to mask ACH entries so that payers could not copy the first entry of the bank account.  Product decided not to do this work, but rather could add some helper text to remind payers to enter the bank account the second time by referring to their check, not what was entered on the screen to reduce ACH returns
7/2- Working with Matt R- possibly will move to PRISM
