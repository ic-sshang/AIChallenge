This document explains the process to get set up on our test Okta instance.  
It’s important to note that this instance is a separate instance to our production Okta instance and therefore means the apps set up on here will be different, it will require an initial set up (described here), and will set up an additional Account on your Okta Verify mobile app.  The only connection between this instance and the production instance is that basic Engineering employee data set up on production instance will be synced down to this instance to avoid an additional step in the onboarding process.
