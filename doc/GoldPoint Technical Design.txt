This would be a change to the AutoPay data pump code only. 
It depends on the customers AutoPay status, and the comment should include “AutoPay enrolled/unenrolled for email address

The error handling on PostComments should not cause a full failure on data pump, as it is a non-critical update.

File Mapping
Invoice File
File Extension: .bif
File Naming Convention: BID_MMDDYYYY
File Delimiter: pipe
Specification: GoldPoint will be using the IC BIF format - see mapping and sample files for billers below
File Transfer Frequency: Daily. New invoice records are sent to IC for new loans and once a payment is made to satisfy a previous amount owed. (Example: If a payment for $300 was due on 7/1 and made on 6/30, Invoice Cloud would receive a new invoice record on 7/1 with an updated amount and due date, regardless of how far into the future the due date is). If a partial payment is made that does not satisfy a previous amount owed to change the statement cycle, IC will use RTDR to update the balance, a new invoice record will not be sent to IC in the BIF.
US AUTO BIF MAPPING
note
Note: Loan Types 40-44 and accounts in the following statuses are not included in the BIF (Closed, Bankruptcy, Charged Off and Repo,). If the loan type originates as 40-44 or one of the mentioned status and later changes to a value other than 40-44 or becomes active, it will be included in the BIF the following day.


Note: Loan Types 40-44 and accounts in the following statuses are not included in the BIF (Closed, Bankruptcy, Charged Off and Repo,). If the loan type originates as 40-44 or one of the mentioned status and later changes to a value other than 40-44 or becomes active, it will be included in the BIF the following day.

N: An account will be flagged with “N” in SpecID 8 each time a new statement is generated. GPS generates monthly statements based on calculated information on the loan. Statements are generated in the afterhours according to the Due Date (LNDUDT) of that month’s cycle and the Coupon/Bill Cycle field (LNBCYC). For example, let’s say an account has LNBCYC set to “20 days before the due date,” and the Due Date is 09/03/2021, then on 08/14/2021, GPS would include the account in the BIF file and designate that account with “N” in SpecID 8 field. If the account were delinquent (e.g., two months late; Due Date was two months in the past from the month of statement generation), it would be calculated using the Due Date of that cycle and the Coupon/Bill Cycle for that month.
For new, purchased, or converted loans, use “N” in SpecID if the Open Loan Posting Date (MRFUND) is equal to the run date (date the BIF file is generated).
R: Send in “R” with accounts that have been updated with important information Invoice Cloud needs to display proper account information. This will be based off the Last Activity Date (LNACTV). Statement generation does not update the Last Activity Date. Transactions and field changes to accounts that do update the Last Activity Date include:
Payments
Reversing the payments
Changing the Due Date
Paying off a loan
Accounts that have been in bankruptcy, charged-off, or flagged as repossession will be sent with “R” in SpecID 8, as well as marking the account as “I” (inactive) in SpecID 409 field.
D: This will be used sparingly. Sending an account with this information indicates to delete the account on record. Clients will communicate with GOLDPoint Systems if they boarded a loan in error and now need to remove the account from Invoice Cloud. GOLDPoint Systems will send “D” in the SpecID field for the deleted account, should this ever occur.

AMERIFIRST BIF MAPPING
note
Areas in blue below refer to custom logic for
 BID 1768 only - biller no longer processing with IC
Custom1 is used for InvoiceTypeID mapping (InvoiceTypeID value in BIF is ignored and replaced with this mapping). This mapping is setup in Advanced Setting 40. 
Formatting example = 198(830,831)|199(840,841)|183(NA) 
Groups are separated by a pipe
Number outside the parenthesis is the InvoiceTypeID
Branches values (from Custom1) are inside the parenthesis, comma separated 
The last group is for defaults, anything not mapped on the previous groups will be set to the InvoiceTypeID for the (NA) group.
Click here for branch mapping details
If AmeriFirst adds new branches, an Integration Modification needs to be submitted to IT containing the branch values that need to be mapping to the appropriate InvoiceTypeID. Generally, when a new branch needs to be mapping, the biller also wants as new TD. Sample: Please map branches 999 and 000 to Invoice Type ID 44.

The code is using the web service URL (
https://api.goldpointsystems.com/paymentapi/api/v1/Payment
/SubmitExternalPayment
) and changes the last portion of the URL based on the function needed. Example: For a void, the code uses Advanced Setting 11 and replaces ‘SubmitExternalPayment’ with “VoidExternalPayment”.

Payer Experience
Payers will access Invoice Cloud from the Biller website (URL redirect). Payers will use the IC Virtual Site and Customer Portal.
Biller Experience
U.S. Auto is currently the only GoldPoint biller using CloudPay for CSR/CIM payments. U.S. Auto uses CloudPay for 
debit card payments only.
Billers will use GoldPoint’s EZPay page to make payments via Invoice Cloud’s Cloud Pay product. Biller will access the ‘EZPay’ screen, choose the Type of Payment, Payment Amount and whether or not GoldPoint is going to ‘waive’ the service fee for the payer. (Note: EZPay only routes Debit Card payments to Invoice Cloud. ACH payments will remain being sent directly to the bank, outside of IC). Once the payment is submitted, you will see the payment on the account in multiple places, pictured below:

All values passed in standard BIF format without intervention from IC during the time of import 
Goldpoint is going to create a generic BIF for all billers. Custom9 will provide values which dictate the number of digits from the AccountNumber value that should be used to create the DisplayAccountNumber value. IC will create the DisplayAccountNumber and insert into the file for import.
Example: GoldPoint will pass the following values in the BIF:
AccountNumber = 0055-999999
Custom9 = 2-6
IC will use the two values above to create the DisplayAccountNumber = 55-999999 
(The 2 from Custom9 refers to the last two characters right justified from the value before the hyphen. The 6 from Custom9 refers to the 6 characters right justified from the value after the hyphen.)

Send AutoPay changes via Data Pump to GoldPoint Comment API
AutoPay enrolled/unenrolled for email address 
xxxx@xxx.com
Since we cannot access customer changes, we would like this to focus on calling Goldpoint’s PostComments API after the AutoPay Registration API. This would be a change to the AutoPay data pump code only.

Biller would like a JSON file format instead of csv. IC will send a changelog file at the end of the day to address all customer changes. 
Add a new File Type InvoiceCloud JSON Format in FTP export.  Fields should only be populated when changes occur.
