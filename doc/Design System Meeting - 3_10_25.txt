Modern.js framework: Finally figured out build issue. 6 weeks of debugging later... turns out I found a legit deployment bug which will get fixed in their next release

Still feeling confident since the creator of MF recommends it as the top compatible framework.
Modern.js routing/routing in module-federation in general:
Having the host app own all of the routing is the simplest approach and the one that is more advised.
Otherwise you have to develop a complex mechanism to bi-directionally sync the routing state between the host's router implementation and [each] child module's router module implementation.
Modern.js: as a build tool it uses Rspack instead of Webpack

MUI Table package exploration: seems to support everything that we need for tables so far and for free.
Blockers: deployment fix in next Modern.js release
Overall milestones/next steps:
Framework:
Figure out injection question, ie can we build once and deploy the same bundle to different environments?
5 different remote URLS:
DEV
IAT (internal testing)
QAR (regression)
XAT (external testing)
PRD
Page by page or feature by feature
Should we try to limit the number of micro-frontends we create to reduce complexity? When working locally for example, this means you have to have 
x
 amount of repos running 
npm run dev
 simultaneously.
Another layer of complexity is introduced in the feature by feature path where we have to also sync any frontend state between multiple mounted react apps on a single page  
<div id="feature1"></div>
 , 
<div id="feature2"></div>
, 
<div id="feature3"></div>
It seems like page by page is still the least complex path? We limit the amount of micro-frontends created as well as limit the routing to the top-level shell application. Solving the big, single, monolithic build problem without adding a complexity problem.
Implement Figma Code Connect
We’re also reviewing table and charting plugins – looking to have suggestions by the end of the month
Martin would like to test out consuming the design system himself to take it through its paces when ready
Next Steps
Reach out to determine when modern.js will fix the build bug
Land on table and chart components
Land on requirements for finalizing/proving the PoC
