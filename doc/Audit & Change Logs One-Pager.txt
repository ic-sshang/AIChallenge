Problem Alignment
Problem: What is the friction or opportunity?
We receive sporadic requests to improve audit/change logs.  There are a variety of ways for billers and IC staff to change settings and configurations in our system, but the who, when, and what for those changes may not be fully captured or viewable.  This is a concern when a biller needs to explain a change that impacted a payer, or when IC staff need to explain a change that impacted any end-user.
Why: How do we know this is a real problem and worth solving?
The problem was realized through biller feedback and HD tickets.
Audience: Who are we building this for?
Billers 
- Our clients will benefit from having visibility to details that are required to fulfill their auditing process.
Biller Support
 - This team will benefit from fewer HD tickets asking for relevant tracking details, or to be able to supply certain details that may not be accessible to end-users.
Success: How do we know if we’ve solved this problem?
Our goal is to collect and provide detailed tracking information that will satisfy biller auditing requirements, as well as any internal auditing requirements.
