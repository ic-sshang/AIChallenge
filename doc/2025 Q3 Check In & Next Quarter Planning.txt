 Open Questions
Provide a list of any discussion questions the team has, especially if there are decisions/actions needed to unblock the next quarter’s roadmap. 
How much time in Q4 should we reserve for INFRA Requests?
We got 5 App Onboarding requests that came in late August/early September, and the App Teams were expecting us to turnaround within Q3 but we did not have capacity due to current commitments and the other INFRA request load.  There is a desire to have the Application Onboarding more automated, or self-serve model but that does put at risk how well the Platform Team will be able to support the Workloads if that model is followed and increases risk of unsupportable architecture as we have seen recently with the Payer Agent project.
