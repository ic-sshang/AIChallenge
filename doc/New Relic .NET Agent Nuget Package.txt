This document explains how to install the .NET agent using NuGet.
Install agent using NuGet
The 
NewRelic.Agent NuGet package
 places the New Relic agent in your application's build output directory so that the agent gets deployed with your application.
Before installing the agent using NuGet, understand these important points:
In order to configure environment variables and directory permissions, you must have access to the systems where you are deploying your applications.
If you're using NuGet to update an existing .NET agent, this will overwrite previously made changes to 
newrelic.config
. To preserve changes, first save the config file outside of your project, then restore it after updating.
Here's an example of using NuGet via Visual Studio to install the .NET agent:
Open your Visual Studio solution, 
Open the 
Package Manager console
 by selecting 
Tools > Nuget Package Manager > Package Manager Console
. Set your project as the default project.
From the Package Manager command prompt, type 
Install-Package NewRelic.Agent
 and press 
Enter
. When you build your project, the .NET agent folder will be copied to your build output directory.
Set environment variables (below) and any other necessary configuration. How to do this will vary, depending on your environment and system.
