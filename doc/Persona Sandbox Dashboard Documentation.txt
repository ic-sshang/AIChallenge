Persona Sandbox Dashboard Documentation
The 
Persona Sandbox
 provides a safe environment to test 
KYC, KYB, and AML flows
 before deploying them in production. It mirrors the production dashboard, but all data is 
test-only
.
The Sandbox dashboard is organized into 
four main sections
:
Identity
Developer
Admin
Platform
Each section has menus and submenus designed for different use cases.
