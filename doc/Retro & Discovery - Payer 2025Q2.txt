High-Level Summary & Trends
Key Insights:
Speed:
 Issue cycle time slowed in Q2, but both PR and epic cycle times improved, indicating faster delivery on larger work items and code changes.
Quality:
 Improvement in defect resolution speed (MTTR) and a drop in new defects opened per week, suggesting better code stability and issue management.
Process:
 Increase in throughput and sprint completion rate, with improved traceability of PRs. However, higher sprint addition rate and slightly decreased predictability point to more reactive, less stable planning.
Overall Performance Trends:
From Q1 to Q2 2025, the team demonstrated significant gains in quality and throughput. Defects were resolved much faster, fewer new defects were opened, and overall output nearly doubled. Process improvements are evident in better PR linking and completion rates, though the team experienced more mid-sprint scope changes and a slight dip in sprint predictability. The trend is toward increased delivery and quality, with a need to balance improved output with more stable planning and predictable sprints.
SPAM - AI Impact
SPAM - AI Impact
Key Insights:
While 
Copilot increases throughput
, it also 
slightly increases work and review times
. This trade-off may be acceptable or even beneficial if the quality and quantity of output improve. The growing adoption rate suggests teams are finding value in Copilot, but it may be worth investigating:
Whether the increased time is due to complexity or inefficiencies.
If training or best practices could reduce the overhead while maintaining high throughput.
