Level of Effort Assumption
Level of Effort (LOE) estimates
 represent the approximate duration required to complete work, based on a typical delivery team of 3–4 resources. These estimates assume that teams can execute the work without external dependencies or constraints.
With a typical team size, the estimated level of effort is:
X-Small

0.5 month

Eligibility Gates (CIS Delivery + Compliance/KYC/OFAC)
Ensure no payout occurs unless:
Transactions are confirmed as delivered to CIS (biller’s system of record), and
The biller passes regulatory and compliance checks (KYC, OFAC, AML, sanctions, good standing).
This prevents drift between IC ledger, CIS, and funding, and enforces regulatory auditability.

Eligibility & Compliance Checks Before Funding
Prevent payouts to billers who fail 
regulatory compliance checks
 (KYC, AML, OFAC, sanctions, good-standing). 
Establish a clear gating mechanism that blocks funding for non-compliant billers, enforces regulatory auditability, and provides Finance/Ops with evidence, override workflows, and SLA-driven queues for resolution.
🔴 
Net-New Dev — Functional
Eligibility gate in Funding Orchestrator:
 block payouts unless:
KYC status = complete
OFAC = clear (no matches)
Biller = active/in good standing
Define hard vs soft checks:
Hard block: failed KYC, OFAC match, terminated biller.
Soft warning: expiring KYC docs, pending re-KYC, fraud flag under review.
Manual override workflow:
 Ops escalates to Compliance; Compliance approves or rejects release.
Audit log:
 persist decision, approver, timestamp, and evidence of override.
How users are alerted:
When a payout batch is blocked, a 
CSV exception report is generated and emailed daily
 to Compliance + Ops (interim mechanism).
Each line lists: biller ID, reason (OFAC fail, KYC pending, inactive), and status = BLOCKED.

Funding for Non-Chase Rails 
(PayPal, Hyperwallet, OBD, CAS, etc.)
Standardize funding for 
all non-Chase payment rails
 (PayPal OneBatch, Hyperwallet, Braintree, OBD, CAS) under the PayFac model.
Today, PayPal/Hyperwallet payouts bypass IC and fund billers directly. 
Going forward, all 
non-Chase funds must flow into IC’s FBO account
, be recorded in 
one unified ledger
, and then be included in 
NACHA funding instructions
 alongside Chase Commerce transactions. 
This provides Finance with a single funding source of truth, ensures consistency across billers, and aligns with PayFac operations.

Net-New Dev — Functional:
Redirect 
PayPal OneBatch payouts
 to IC’s 
FBO account
 instead of directly to biller accounts.
Enhance the 
Funding Engine
 to ingest PayPal/Hyperwallet/OBD funding files and record deposits into the unified ledger.
Ensure NACHA payout instructions include 
non-Chase rail funds
 (i.e., treat them the same as Chase Commerce deposits when disbursing to billers).
Funding Engine generates 
single consolidated NACHA instructions
 covering both Chase and non-Chase payouts. 
Validate: one ledger for all payment sources (Chase + non-Chase).
