Analysis
The App Gateway was able to seemlessly take on the traffic as the traffic ramped up and was able to see a clear increase in the Capacity Units used by the App Gateway.  Under the initial Load of 5,000 Virtual Users the Estimated Billed Capacity Units did spike to 50, which then reduced as the Test Cases began to spread out due to the nature of the response times of the calls and the random wait times built into the Test Cases to more better model real world traffic patterns.  All latency could be attributed to the resource scarcity of the backend Service VMs (specifically the single Proxy VM used by all 10 DevTest Web Server VMs) and is clearly shown in the
