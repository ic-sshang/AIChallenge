Summary
The Insurity Workmans Comp Express (WCXP) is a real-time EBPP integration using web services for all data transfer. The integration utilizes CloudPayV2 for Self-Reporting (when the employer reports payroll information, CloudPayV2 is utilized to create a statement and accept payment).
The integration utilizes Embedded/iFrame SSO and requires Multi-User Log In with Co-Owner functionality. 
There are two types of employee benefit options:
Recurring: The employer pays the same amount in workers' compensation dues per month. The employer will receive a monthly statement.
Self-Reporting: The employer pays an amount in workers' compensation dues based on the number of employees per month. The employer must log in to the Insurity Workmans Comp Express (WCXP) portal to report employee numbers and generate the policy statement amount. 
NOTE: 
If the account is enrolled in autopay during payment, autopay won’t actually run in the future. The payer/employer has to log in and manually take action for any invoice to be generated so there would be no future invoice automatically created on IC to run autopay.
A biller may offer both recurring and self-reporting benefit options but each payer/employer would only use one.
Workers' compensation insurance gives employees benefits if they have a work-related injury or illness. Also known as workers' comp or workman's comp insurance, this coverage can help cover injured or sick employees' medical expenses. It can also help replace wages from lost work time. Each state has its own laws and programs for workers' compensation. The federal government also has a separate workers' comp program, mostly for federal employees.
For Insurity Workmans Comp Express (WCXP) integrations, the payers will typically be employers who are paying workers' compensation dues (for employee benefits).
