Invoice Cloud Web Services
The information in the Invoice Cloud Web Services section reflects the information given to Invoice Cloud at the time of Discovery and Design. It is possible for this information to be updated at any time by a biller or CIS Vendor without notifying Invoice Cloud
Cloud Payments V2
Purpose/Summary: This web service based payment integration allows 3rd party applications to utilize a "Pay Now" button within their application to redirect the user to the Invoice Cloud Payment Route where they can enter in all the payment information and submit the payment. Once the payment has been approved, the IC Payment Route will display a printable receipt and provide a method to return the user back to the calling application.
