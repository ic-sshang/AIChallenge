Definitions/Details
AgentConnect
Supported
Use to link various pages of their biller admin portal to Invoice Cloud. The AgentConnect API is similar to our older product, CloudCSRConnect, but has additional security and functionality to better serve both Insurance and GUB biller needs.
Check Free - FISERV - Cash
Supported*
Only supported if biller uses our Online Bank Direct Product. 
This product would be used if municipalities allowed coordinating bill pay with customers banks. A payer will setup a recurring payment or autopay using their bank account and the bank sends over the paper check via FiServ to be applied to the customers account in IC.
CloudPay
Not Supported
CloudPay Web Services
Not Supported
CloudStore
Supported
We can put our Cloud Store in the Virtual Site or we can provide link which is embedded into the CSS website. This is used for ad hoc non-invoice payments. 
Payments are handled manually by the biller. 
CSRConnect
Not Supported*
Note: It’s still using by some Billers; however, Cayenta no longer uses it.
*Biller must be on CU Version 7.9.0 or higher and CSS gen 3 to support CSRConnect.

This can be used to sign up a new account for paperless and autopay services. 
EMV
Supported
Biller Portal payments only. 
IVR
Supported
Standard:
 SearchByAccountNumber
We can also read a past due amount to the caller. 
Kiosk

Outbound IVR
Supported
POSConnect
Supported*
*
Biller must be on CU Version 7.9.0 or higher and CSS gen 3 to support POSConnect
POSConnect transactions will NOT be sent through the data pump for Cayenta billers. Cayenta posts the payments into 
C
ayenta Utilities after they are made so activating these payments in the data pump would cause duplicate payments on each account.

EMV devices were implemented and integrated into POSConnect for Clayton County only.

Batch Closure
Custom
It is best practice for the Implementation Project Manager to coordinate the Invoice Cloud batch close in league with Cayenta and the biller. Cayenta, the biller, and Invoice Cloud should come to an agreement on a batch close time and then setup maintenance windows around that time. Often the biller will be rebooting resources and Cayenta has some functions in that maintenance window as well.

We support block ACH, block CC and/or cash only based on Advanced Setting 28 (Cayenta Customer Block EFT Indicator). Within this setting we configure the codes provided by Cayenta that are unique to each biller.
