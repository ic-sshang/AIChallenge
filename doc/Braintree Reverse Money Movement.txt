StrategyConfiguration
 - Collect strategies to use for processing RMM records, like verification strategy and recovery strategy.
VerifierStrategy 
- is used to verify request data and determine who should be billed for the transaction.
FirstBillerThenSubscriberVerifierStrategy 
- is the standard verifier strategy used to calculate biller and subscriber coverage. As RMM records are received, this strategy determines the amount that the biller/terminal will cover and the amount that the subscriber will cover. It begins by recovering the principal amount from the biller/terminal and then recovers the remaining fee portion from the subscriber.
NetSettlementVerifierStrategy
- is designed to work with 
NetSettlementRecoveryStrategy 
to validate if the net settlement record has been processed.
RecoveryStrategy
 -processes every verification from the 
VerifierStrategy 
and updates records accordingly.
DebitBundleRecoveryStrategy 
- is a strategy for recovering funds by debiting either the biller/terminal or subscriber. This strategy bundles verifications into a single recovery.
DebitPerRecordRecoveryStrategy 
- is a strategy for recovering funds by debiting either the biller/terminal or subscriber. This strategy creates a single recovery for each verification. 
VerificationInquiryRecovery
 - is used solely for analyzing verification. This will be utilized when netting out RMM records from funding batches. 
NetSettlementRecoveryStrategy 
- after an RMM record has been netted out of a funding batch, we insert a net settlement record. This record indicates that we haven't imported these records into the subscriber's system yet. The subscriber collects these records from a report and uses the API to process these net settlements. After processing, we mark the net settlement as processed and recover any fee-related funds from the subscriber.
