When to Create Test Cases
Start during story grooming
: Begin adding test cases during the story grooming session. This helps in identifying and covering basic scenarios early in the development process.
How to Add Test Cases
Use the Test Coverage plugin in JIRA
: This plugin allows you to add new or existing test cases directly in JIRA.
Link test cases to the parent Epic
: Always ensure that each test case is linked to the relevant Epic to maintain traceability and organization.
Mandatory Fields in a Test Case
Issue Type
: Should be set to “Test” to categorize it correctly.
Summary
: Provide a brief description of the scenario being tested.
Reported Services
: Indicate the product or service being tested (e.g., Cloud Payments).
Parent
: Link the test case to the appropriate Epic for context.
Test Type
:
Manual UI/API/DB/E2E
: For manual test cases involving user interfaces, APIs, databases, or end-to-end scenarios.
Cucumber UI/API
: For automated test cases written in BDD (Behavior Driven Development) format.
Unit Test & Other Automation
: For end-to-end or integration tests that are automated.
Manual vs. Automated Test Cases
Automated Tests
: Use Cucumber UI/API or other automation frameworks for test cases that can be automated.
Manual Tests
: If automation is not feasible immediately, use Manual UI/API/DB/N2N. Provide a justification for not automating, such as time constraints.
Workflow of Test Cases
Story Grooming
: Add acceptance criteria as Xray test cases during the grooming session.
Testing
: Execute the test case and update its status to “In Progress” while testing.
Resolving
: Mark test cases as “Resolved” before the story can move to the Deployment Queue.
Automating Later
: If automation is pending, mark the test as “Time Constraint”. Once automated, change the test type to Cucumber UI/API and resolve it.
Structure of Test Cases & Test Sets
Grouping
: Use test sets to group multiple test cases for regression testing or specific flows.
UI Navigation
: Structure test cases to match the UI navigation for easy search and reference.
API Documentation
: For API tests, follow the structure of the API documentation.
Reuse
: Always check for existing test cases before creating new ones. Use the “Quality Engineering” filter to find previously created test cases.
BDD Format (Given-When-Then)
All functional and integration tests must follow the BDD format, which helps in writing clear and understandable test cases.
Automation Process & Framework
Steps for Automating a Test Case
:
Write the test case in BDD format in Xray.
Implement the automation in the QA Source Repo.
Create a Pull Request (PR) in the QA repo.
Obtain 2 approvals before merging the PR.
Merge the PR only after the story reaches the Deployment Queue.
Framework Structure
: Specific repositories (e.g., Cloud Payments, CRM) contain feature-specific steps for automation.
Tagging & Pipeline Execution
Tagging
: Use tags like @AutoPay, @DataPump, etc., to identify and run related tests. Multiple tags can be added to a single test case.
Running Test Cases
: Use the pipeline to execute test cases in different environments. Tags help in running specific scenarios.
Prod
: Runs in the regression environment.
Test
: Runs in the DevTest environment with specific biller shards.
Final Note
Aim to automate test cases within the sprint and use the correct test type for tracking manual vs. automated tests.
