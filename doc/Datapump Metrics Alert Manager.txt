Details
Application Name
Datapump Metrics Alert Manager
Version
NA
Description
This is a console-based CRON job deployed in the Biller Kubernetes cluster. It runs every minute to provide near real-time alerts to billers when their CIS APIs—invoked by the Datapump executable (triggered by a Skybot job via the Datapump Controller)—exceed predefined performance thresholds.
The job sends alerts (Email via Mailgun API) for the key metrics such as:
Average Response Time
Error Rate Percentage
Timeout Error Rate
Thresholds for these metrics are configured in CRM for Datapump-enabled billers. When a threshold is breached, the job automatically sends alert emails to the respective billers, helping them identify and address performance issues in their APIs that may be slowing down the Datapump job.
Primary Functionality
Trigger real-time alerts when configured thresholds are breached, ensuring prompt detection and resolution of issues affecting the Datapump data synchronization process.
Key Features
Automated Email Notifications, Threshold-Based Alerting, Kubernetes-Based Deployment, CronJob, Dotnet 8, Entity Framework(ORM).
