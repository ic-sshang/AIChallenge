User Interaction and Design
Data Flow - Payment
Payments are made in the backend with REST Webservice calls with InvoiceCloud. GeoCivix is the owner of the UI/UX. 
Data Flow - Void
Voids will be processed through Biller Portal if needed.
Data Flow - ACH Reject
ACH Rejects can be reviewed through the Biller Portal. 
Payer Experience
Payers will process payments on the GeoCivix website. The payment portal will not have any InvoiceCloud verbiage as all payments will be processed in the backend. The data will be entered in GeoCivix and sent to InvoiceCloud via webservice.
