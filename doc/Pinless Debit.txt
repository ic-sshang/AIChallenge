How does it work? 
Pinless debit is handled in the background and has no visual changes to the payment processing flow. Payers and/or Billers will process a Credit Card payment through the normal payment route and will process through Chase/Paymentech Gateway. CTP will verify the BIN range of the Card against the Pinless Debit BIN ranges that we have in the database and if it is a valid Pinless Debit Card we will process it with specific values before transmitting it over to Chase. 
How to Identify if it's a Pinless Debit Payment?
 
Query database table PinlessDebitPayments under a Biller's respective shard.
 
sql
select top 100 * from PinlessDebitPayments order by 1 desc
Pinless Debit Reliability Issues and Solution
Background:
 We have encountered reliability issues with Pinless Debit due to problems on Chase’s side or with our Pinless Debit BIN files provided by Chase. This results in the error message: 
“9797 PINLess Debit: Card Number Not Eligible for PINLess Debit Processing”
. When this error occurs, payers must either use another card or we must disable Pinless Debit on affected terminals.
Solution:
 To address this, we have implemented retry logic for this specific error. If a payment fails, it will be retried as a non-Pinless Debit transaction. The failed transaction will be recorded in New Relic, and alerts will be configured to notify teams of any potential issues with Pinless Debit. This solution allows payers to continue processing their payments without interruption. (Solution Released on 11/14/2024 -
