 Sprint planning meeting items
Perform backlog grooming, breakdown stories, and size them 
Stories should be no larger than 5pts with preference towards 1-3 points. 
For this sprint, we will push several epics to finish line but for future sprints, we will want to minimize the number of parallel projects in flight.   “more wood behind the arrow”

Potential risks
Risk
Mitigation
Open issue with MSFT and DataFactory setups. 
Keith following up with DBS team. consistent follow up with MSFT. 
Maintenance scheduled for middle of Sprint6
scheduled ‘research and planning’ time for operations teams to handle change documentation and research needs. 
Prior Sprint Retro
Well: Keep Doing
Standups kept the team informed and allowed for collaboration
Maintenance confluence page!!! 
Epic for Maintenance releases
Collaboration
Items moved everyday across the board - sizing and scoping was generally good across the board
What should we change?
Meeting and break/fix demands accounted for more time than planned.  - how much of this was Q4 planning surge vs normal activities?
Grooming meeting - lean in.  attend.    If you cannot - do not. 
Camera On
Board and Process cleanup.   PR process - 2 reviewers. documented in Jira.  submitter can complete once .  add review/test column in board. 
work with peers to test vs test yourself and have peer review.
updated boards/workflow in Sprint8. 
Didn’t go well: Stop doing
eliminate navigating around EBPP and PLAT boards (Ray to investigate)
