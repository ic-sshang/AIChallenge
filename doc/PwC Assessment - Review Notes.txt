Question for Chase - in today’s environment, Chase provides updates and impact to any upcoming network changes. Will they continue to do this, or will we be responsible for this?

Making changes to pricing is difficult, we need to make sure the new contract includes verbiage around adjusting pricing based on network fee changes, etc.
We need to understand what pricing changes we will need to account for? Initially, I assumed pricing for billers would remain the same? If there are additional pricing elements, we need to include those in the build out so we can support it going forward. Do competitors have additional fees that we should include placeholders for creative pricing? (platform fees, service fees, reserves, etc from slide 37)

Is communication phase 2 - where we build out sending updates on changes to status, etc within a dashboard? Or do we see this as a must have?
Can we continue to use our existing processes today for communications? Should we lean on Anita’s team to be the touch point for communications with billers?

When PWC references that we need to lock down other payment types so only the accepted payment types are visible….don’t we do this today? Is this just saying we need to make sure we keep these same processes as we transition to Payfac?

We need to define the payout schedule? Based on what we’ve learned so far, it seems like we may have a funding deposit delay with Payfac compared to how we fund today…do we offer a standard payout schedule and then offer customizations for next day funding etc, in Phase 2? We need to confirm what our approach will be. We also need to confirm will standard funding be net settlement or gross? etc Lots of decisions needed around funding.

There is a call out for us to connect with Chase to understand the network fees. We may need to dig into this a little deeper. I’m not clear on how this will change? 
InvoiceCloud should obtain detailed billing information from Chase to make sure accurate pass-through of costs to billers. In particular, InvoiceCloud should discuss with Chase the billing requirements for network fees and how they will be structured and passed through to billers.
