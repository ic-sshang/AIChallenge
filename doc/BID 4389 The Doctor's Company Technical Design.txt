When coding was completed to datapump DOCPAC (contribution) payments, the DocpacPayMethodAccountType = “P”ersonal, “C”orporate, or “L”lc was not completed since this was waiting on a product enhancement to capture this information.  Curerntly this field is set to null.
Modify datapump for DOCPAC payments to indicate the DocpacPayMethodAccountType by using the first letter of the DonationEntityTypeDesc.
