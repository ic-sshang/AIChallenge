 Potential Risk - 
ApplePay may involve some unknowns
WT-72 was moved to an initiative for reporting purposes
 
TT-22: Visa Commercial Interchange Update
Delivery 
 At Risk
Delayed due to following reasons
External Dependency:
 Chase’s responses were slower with delays in sharing required documents and identifying root causes.
Internal Analysis:
 Additional time was spent on our side to pinpoint the root cause of the 
null zip code
 issue.
We are also facing an 
ongoing risk
:
Null zip codes are originating from billers integrated with 
BS&A
, where we don't have control on their interface, the risk and impact are to be borne.

 At Risk
All vendors rely on a common DB (EWS) plus in-house data. While they claim higher efficiency, proof requires sharing sensitive account data. Pricing discussions with Chase AVS are in progress; efficiency testing will follow.

Discovery 
Delivery in Q4
 Delayed
Over the past weeks, Team had multiple discussions with the onboarding team to understand the current 
manual onboarding process
 in detail. Finalizing the biller wizard flow has taken slightly longer than anticipated, which has contributed to some delay.
In parallel, the team has been focusing on building the 
Onboarding API
, which will serve as the backend for the portal. This ensures that once the biller wizard flow is finalized, the API will be readily available and fully aligned to support it.
This approach minimizes overall downstream impact — while the flow finalization is in progress, the backend infrastructure is being prepared in advance.
