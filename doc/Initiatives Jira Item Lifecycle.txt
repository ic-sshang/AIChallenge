Introduction
Initiative items are first identified, reviewed, and/or groomed in the Discovery phase before moving into the Delivery phase. In the Delivery phase, items are ready for dev, in progress, blocked, peer reviewed, reviewed by the CRC, and deployed when finished.
The progress of an Initiative Jira item can be tracked via the Status indicator on the top-right of the item.
