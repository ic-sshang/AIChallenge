Frequently Asked Questions
General Questions
Q: How is the AI Report Generator different from other reporting tools?
 
A: The AI Report Generator allows you to create reports using natural language instead of learning complex report builders or query languages. It interprets your request and automatically generates the appropriate report.
Q: Is this replacing existing reporting tools?
 
A: No. The AI Report Generator complements our existing reporting tools. Standard reports remain available in the Reporting menu.
Q: Who can access the AI Report Generator?
 
A: Users who have been granted the "AI Report Generator" permission (47) by their administrator can access this feature.

Using the Tool
Q: How many criteria can I include in a query?
 
A: For optimal results, we recommend limiting your query to six or fewer criteria. More complex queries may still work but could be less reliable.
Q: Can I save my reports for future use?
 
A: Yes, you can save a prompt that you have just used to generate results. Additionally, you can export your results to Excel for saving.
Q: What types of data can I report on?
 
A: Currently, you can generate reports on accounts, invoices, payments, scheduled payments, chargebacks, ACH rejects, and Expiring Cards. More report types will be added in future updates.
Q: Why do my results sometimes vary when I run the same query multiple times?
 
A: We're actively working on improving consistency. For now, using more specific criteria and consistent phrasing will help ensure reliable results. Please report any inconsistencies via the Feedback link on the page.
Q: Can a biller generate a Cloud Store payment report and upload it to update their CIS?
A: Right now, the report can include basic Cloud Store payment details like date, amount, and invoice type, but it doesn’t yet support custom fields that billers may have added. We’re looking into this as a possible enhancement down the line.
Q: Can the AI Report Generator be used for inbound and outbound payments in insurance?
A: Yes, the AI Report Generator can report on inbound payments—such as those made on policies or renewals—just like it does for service payments in utilities. It pulls data from any payments processed through InvoiceCloud, similar to the Search Payments report.
However, outbound payments in insurance are more complex and currently not supported by the AI Report Generator, but this is on the radar for future development.
Troubleshooting
Q: What should I do if I get an error (no results)?
 
A: Try rephrasing your query to be less specific such as a larger date range or fewer criteria, as this indicates there simply isn’t any data matching those particular parameters.
Q: Why am I not seeing the AI Report Generator in my menu?
 
A: You may not have the required permission (47). Contact your system administrator to request access.
Q: Can I request specific features or improvements?
 
A: Yes! We welcome your feedback to improve the tool. Please submit the feedback form with your suggestions.
