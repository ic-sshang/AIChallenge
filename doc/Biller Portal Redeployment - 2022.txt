Background
The Biller Portal code base has been separated from the monolithic application into it’s own application. This allows us to make changes faster and other good stuff..
Scope of Change
NEW LOGGED IN URL (my.invoicecloud.com)
After logging in, the Biller user will be redirect to a new URL that will now include a subdomain “MY”
CURRENT: https://www.invoicecloud.com/portal/BillerWelcome.aspx
CURRENT: https://www.invoicecloud.com/(billername)/BillerWelcome.aspx
NEW: https://my.invoicecloud.com/(same as before)
Daily code merges until full production rollout
IC developers will on a daily basis merge any code changes to the new application branch
We want to minimize how long we have to do this, thus, the faster we get this done the better
Update all Demo Portals to redirect to the new subdomain in early February
Update Production to redirect as a slow rollout starting in late February
Update Pendo with new URL scheme
No Changes
Biller Login Page URL: 
https://www.invoicecloud.com/portal/BillerLogin.aspx
Bookmarks do not need to change
Biller Login Landing Page Design
SessionID remains in the URL
E.g., https://www.invoicecloud.com/(billername)/
(S(tokv3oysmuxtreloun4wepvi))
/BillerWelcome.aspx 
Still won’t make it easy to do deeplinking
