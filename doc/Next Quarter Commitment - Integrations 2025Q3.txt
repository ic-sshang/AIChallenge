Data Pump Alert Enhancements are deployed for:
Big and VIP Billers are identified, and changes are deployed  
Systems and Software 
changes are deployed 
Note: 
If changes for Big and VIP billers can be deployed in a single deployment, then there will not be any need for Phase 3
DataPump v2 Redesign - Technical Discovery for decoupling existing systems (IC systems)
DD & CC
 
 
Commitment Statements and Success Measures – DataPump V2:
Obtain sign-off on the proposed approach from all relevant stakeholders.
Success Measure: Approach is formally approved by all stakeholders, with all queries addressed and documented.
Develop an MVP with decoupled transaction-type-specific sources in DataPump V2 to enhance modularity and scalability.
Success Measure: 100% of transaction types are processed through independently decoupled DataPump V2 sources.
Optimize record processing performance, ensuring faster post-to-biller times compared to DataPump V1.
Success Measure: Average post-to-biller response time is reduced compared to DataPump V1.
Establish a clear transition strategy to onboard subset of exisiting billers from DataPump V1 to V2 seamlessly.
Success Measure: Transition plan documented, communicated, and at least 3 billers successfully migrated from V1 to V2 during initial rollout. 
[Strategy/Plan only]
The development will be guided by:
Implementation of an Event-Driven Architecture to enable scalable, asynchronous processing.
Design of a resilient messaging model incorporating persistence, retry logic, and idempotency to ensure reliable and duplicate-free data delivery.
Note:
 Further development activities will commence once the MVP is accepted and will be planned based on the outcomes and feedback expected by the end of Q3.
