Step 1: Run Initial Query to Check DataPump Activity
Use the following SQL query to inspect recent DataPump records:
SELECT TOP (100000)  
    T.DataPumpTypeDesc,  
    tp.paymentsourcedesc  
FROM dbo.DataPump D  
JOIN dbo.tblDataPumpType T ON T.DataPumpTypeID = D.DataPumpTypeID  
JOIN tblpaymentsource tp ON tp.paymentsourceid = D.paymentsourceid  
ORDER BY D.DateRecAdded DESC
What to Look For:
Records with 
DateDelivered = NULL
 may be normal for high-volume billers.
Re-run the query after a few minutes to check if these records are diminishing.
If records are diminishing, data is flowing and the alert can be closed.
If not, proceed to further checks.
Step 2: Check for Errors or Exceptions
Inspect the 
Response
 field in the result set for any error messages.
Common Issues:
Timeout exceptions
Endpoint unreachable
Other error messages
Action:
Report findings in the 
production-ops
 channel.
Close the alert after reporting.
Be aware: You may receive repeated alerts for the same issue.
Step 3: Check for Stuck Processing Bit
Symptoms:
DateDelivered
 is not updating.
Records are continuously adding up.
Confirmation Query
SELECT * FROM dbo.BillerDataPump
What to Look For:
If 
LastUpdated
 is 30+ minutes old, this may indicate a stuck bit.
Action:
Get a second opinion if you are new to this process.
If confirmed, reach out to 
Data Services
 to reset the bit.
Alternatively, use the 
CRM tool
 (requires permission).
