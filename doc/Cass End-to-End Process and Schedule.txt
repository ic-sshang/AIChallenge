Overview:
This documentation covers the end-to-end run we did when we initially tested the cases process. This will explain how the overall process works and how BMS and Wicked Tendies' repos work side by side with one another.
BMS Repository
MC_RPPS
: imports RPPS payments and attempts automatic matching
MC_RPPS – cassrun
: sends matched RPPS batches to the gateway and handles return/reversal files
Wicked Tendies Repository
CassApplyScheduledLedgerEntries
: applies previous-day ledger entries
CassBankActivityImport
: imports daily bank activity (500) files
CassNachaFileCreation
: generates NACHA files (Step 1 at 4 pm CST) and uploads them for approval (Step 2 at 5 pm CST)
CassFileReceiptProcessing
: imports and processes NACHA receipt files (5:30 pm CST)
Together, these jobs simulate the full OBD payment lifecycle— from activating a biller and configuring terminals/banks, through batch funding and file exchanges, to address verification (CASS) and return handling.
