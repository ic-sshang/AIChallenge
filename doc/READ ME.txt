How to use the database
Use the Integration Project Ideas database to share ideas on functionality for the entire integrations space
Use the search functionality to help avoid duplication
We will meet regularly to discuss it
Use the Project Brainstorming folder and create a new page for your idea if it’s big enough or fleshed out enough
Link to any and all available documentation
This is not meant for bugs or known work - this is a discovery zone
Team Agreements
Don’t be held back by past experiences or frustrations
Don’t assume that if you put it on here it will be built
Don’t just delete stuff
Don’t be shy
