Note: If the application is ran before 9:00am CT, make sure to comment out
var dailyBillerMgtReportEmailStatus = ApplicationHealthChecker.IsDailyBillerMgtReportEmailHealthy(); Console.WriteLine({0,-40}: {1}", "Daily Biller Mgt Report Email Status", dailyBillerMgtReportEmailStatus);
 
in the Program.cs code because this job runs at 9:00am CT.
The BMS Application Health Check is a task to check if all the applications that come under Billing Me Softly are healthy. The application lives in 
Src_Miscellaneous → BMSApplicationHealthCheck repo → ApplicationHealthChecker.cs
 on Azure DevOps. This application was created as a quick and easy program instead of calling the SQL Queries on the BMS Application Health Check 
excel sheet
.
This application should be run on Bastion server.
Following are the instructions on how to run the application.
Open the 
BMSApplicationHealthCheck repo
 in Visual Studio.
Under ‘Solution Explorer’ set ‘BMSApplicationHealthCheck’ as a Startup Project and run the application.
The results will be seen like this:
Health Test Status = 0 means there is a connection to the database. 
Health Test Status = 1 means there is no connection to the database.
After running the application the health check result is posted on the BMS team channel.
