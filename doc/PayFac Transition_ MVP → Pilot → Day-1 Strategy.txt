MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
The minimum set of capabilities required to technically operate as a PayFac and satisfy Chase’s sponsor bank requirements.
📌 MVP = the 
regulatory baseline
 — without it, we cannot legally or technically operate.
Capabilities:
Biller Onboarding & KYC/AML (Chase Screening API)
Payment Processing (Chase Commerce APIs for auth/capture/void/refund)
Funding via JPMC FBO account (ACH/Wire)
Exception handling (rejects, returns, chargebacks – manual if needed)
Basic daily reporting
Core compliance controls (KYC, fraud monitoring, transaction monitoring)
Testing MVP:
Shadow Mode:
 Validates flows without moving money (API, logic, DB under load).
Pilot Biller:
 Proves end-to-end money movement, funding, and reconciliation through Chase.
👉 The pilot is the “engine test flight” before Day-1 rollout.
One absorbed, one submitter, one cost plus - all with low manageable volume
Day-1 Requirements
What InvoiceCloud needs for customers, finance, and ops to succeed at launch.
📌 Day-1 = the 
operational baseline
 — without it, MVP would be compliant but unusable.
Capabilities:
Configurable payout schedules (default daily, with delay option)
Deposit visibility (payments matched to deposits, exception handling)
Chargeback/refund workflows with notifications and representment
Baseline fraud controls (e.g., AVS/CVV, Certegy replacement)
Biller portal reporting for lifecycle visibility
Operational controls (reconciliations, exception reporting, deposit delays)
Key Distinction
MVP = License to Operate
 (regulatory/legal minimum, fund flows, KYC, transaction processing).
Day-1 = Readiness to Scale
 (reconciliation, reporting, ops tools, payout options).
Bridging MVP and Day-1
Challenge:
 Delivering all Day-1 upfront risks a waterfall build, scope bloat, and delayed learnings.
Approach:
 Deliver MVP first, layer Day-1 capabilities iteratively.
Phases:
MVP 
= pilot biller (1–3)
:
 Core PayFac compliance (KYC, Commerce processing, FBO funding, reporting) + Pilot biller.
Day-1 = ~20 billers within ~3 months:
 Reconciliation tools, chargeback notifications, payout schedule, ops dashboards, small set of pilot billers.
Day-90+ = optimization/scale
: Full go-live with portal reporting, configurable payouts, advanced fraud monitoring, automated reconciliation, 1099-K readiness.
Why This Approach Works
Ops and finance get the tools needed to avoid chaos on Day-1 without overbuilding too early.
Engineering delivers iteratively, learns from pilots, and avoids waterfall.
We balance speed to market (early MVP compliance) with trust and stability (Day-1 readiness).
✅ 
Bottom line:
 MVP gets us live faster and safer, the pilot proves compliance and stability, and Day-1 builds the maturity we need. Doing this in phases gives us both agility and operational stability.
