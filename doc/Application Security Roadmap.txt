 Added T-Shirt sizes to each item based on current knowns, and unknowns, to try to get to date when items would be complete.  These dates are in the Estimated Completion Date column.

 A meeting was held to review priorities on 7/2 and talk other related matters (attended by Jed, Branden, Mirza, Steve S).  This led to many of the top items above shifting in priority.  I changed the priority and updated the Jira items to reflect the change.
