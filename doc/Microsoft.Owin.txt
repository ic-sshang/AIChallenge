About this library
OWIN allows web apps to be decoupled from web servers. It defines a standard way for middleware to be used in a pipeline to handle requests and associated responses. 
http://ASP.NET
  Core applications and middleware can interoperate with OWIN-based applications, servers, and middleware.
OWIN provides a decoupling layer that allows two frameworks with disparate object models to be used together. The 
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Owin
 package provides two adapter implementations:
http://ASP.NET
  Core to OWIN
OWIN to 
http://ASP.NET
  Core
This allows 
http://ASP.NET
  Core to be hosted on top of an OWIN compatible server/host or for other OWIN compatible components to be run on top of 
http://ASP.NET
  Core.
