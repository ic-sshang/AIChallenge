This integration will create Invoice Files (BIF) and Adjustment files (BAF) using the same file transmitted to IC from Southern Software. Special logic will need to be created in the code such that Account records are added to a BIF if we have never seen the Account Number before. If we have, the record will be treated as an adjustment and added to the BAF.
