Whatever code you touch, you must write an integration or unit test.
Eventually you would add new logic to legacy code but as long as you are inserting new well-tested code you won't have to unit test that part of the legacy code.
Data Access Layer or any external call methods should have an integration test. Whatever object is responsible for this logic should be injectable and mockable, usually an interface.
Service methods will usually utilize the DAL objects to perform business operations, therefore we should have a unit test for each method with the DAL objects mocked.
All testing should be properly organized, and mimic the structure of our code, either by namespace or folder structure.
Utilize what's already there.
Framework
Business
TransactionService
ReportingService
HyperWalletService
OnlineBankDirectService
etc.
DAL
TransactionRepository
ReportingRepository
HyperWalletRepository
OnlineBankDirectRepository
etc.
Models
Enums
PaymentType
PaymentStatusType
etc.
Entities
Requests
Responses
Model objects
Interfaces
We should have 1 per Service and Repository in order to make them injectable and mockable.
All jobs and API services in the repo should have access to the Framework code, mainly the Business.
Create new objects 
IF
:
We need Models
We are going to refactor a lot of old code and would like to toggle between old and new logic.
We need to break down and encapsulate legacy code for easier testing, maintenance, and integration of new logic.
We are implementing something completely new if we can't fit it in with our current infrastructure.
Add internal comments to any complex logic - not all code is self-explanatory.
Every new method created, or any method touched should have a proper summary.

Note
Green
 also from this example methods in the repository objects should be named the same as the stored proc they are calling.
