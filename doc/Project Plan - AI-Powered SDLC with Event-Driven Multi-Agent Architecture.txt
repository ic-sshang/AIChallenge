1. Summary
What:
 
AI-Powered SDLC is an enterprise multi-agent platform that augments and automates the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It runs specialized AI agents orchestrated by a stateless Orchestrator and event bus. A centralized Model Gateway controls LLM access and costs. The primary user interfaces are a 
Slack app (IC-AgentHub)
 and a 
React SPA
 for previews, approval flows, and dashboards.
Why:
 
Accelerate PR reviews and test creation
Improve code quality and compliance
Reduce operational and support overhead
Provide measurable ROI and auditability for AI usage
Reduce manual operations in release process
2. Objectives
Deploy a scalable, event-driven multi-agent architecture.
Provide conversational/action based AI workflows via Slack + React SPA.
Enforce security, governance, and auditability with MCP adapters.
Deliver measurable improvements in productivity, quality, and adoption.
3. Scope
In Scope:
 Orchestrator, Service Bus, Model Gateway, core agents (PlanningAgent, XrayAgent, CodeAgent, QAAgent, ReleaseAgent and more), Slack App, React SPA.
Out of Scope:
 Custom LLM training.
4. Architecture Overview
Client Layer accept actions and call Logic & Orchestration Layer.
Stateless Orchestrator publishes RunRequests to Service Bus.
Multi-Agent host consume the request and pass to Agents (PlanningAgent, XrayAgent, CodeAgent, TestAgent, ReleaseAgent and more) , and produce AgentOutputs.
Context & Tooling Layer (MCP Servers) contains different MCP servers per engineering assets like Jira, AzureDevOps, Xray etc.
Slack (IC-AgentHub) and React SPA provide approvals and dashboards.
MCP adapters provide safe, redacted access to Azure DevOps, Jira, and SAST tools.
Explanation of Layers
Client Layer:
 This is the entry point for users. It includes all the interfaces where the engineers will interact with the system, such as a web application or a bot integrated into platforms like Slack.
Logic & Orchestration Layer:
 This layer will support service bus to consume request and publish proposed actions.
Multi-Agent Host:
 The 
Multi-Agent Host
 receives requests, interprets them, and delegates tasks to specialized 
Agents
 (Planning, Code, QA, Security). The host also synthesizes the final output from the agents before sending it back to the user.
Context & Tooling Layer (MCP Servers):
 Each specialized 
MCP Server
 acts as a secure proxy, providing a standardized set of tools for agents to use. This layer protects core assets by preventing agents from having direct, unmanaged access to  APIs.
Core Engineering Assets & Services:
 This layer contains all the backend services and data sources that the system interacts with. These are the single source of truth for  engineering organization, including tools like Jira, Azure DevOps, and external services like Azure OpenAI.

Risks & Mitigations
Hallucination → sandbox CI + approvals
Data leakage → MCP redaction + RBAC
Cost overruns → Model Gateway quotas + caching
Adoption risk → developer champions + training
