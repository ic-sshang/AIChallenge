The purpose of this document is to have a standardized set of admin tasks that are followed by all Project Managers to organize projects. This includes when to procure a project, what folders will be created in the BOX for every project, how to hold IMs accountable for the artifacts that they must manage, what are the PM steps to close a project, and all the corresponding artifacts used during the project.  
Central repository (Box):
 
Boarding will create a folder for your project in the Box, UNDER Public – Operations\Billers\. The name of the folder is the Biller ID followed by the company name and the State initials.  Example: 
4217 Cherokee County NA 
3643 Utilities Holdings LA. 
The folder will be the central repository of artifacts required to execute and complete your project. You should not duplicate artifacts already stored in our enterprise tools (Salesforce, Smartsheet, Confluence, etc.). 
Timing:
 
All folders, files, and artifacts related to a project should be prepared and filed during the project life cycle.  The requirement for PMs is to have all documentation properly filed as part of the closing phase of the project.  Management can audit any project’s filing order as part of the PMs’ KPIs.
