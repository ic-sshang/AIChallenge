Overview
This Article is to show you how to use a webservice call to test the UploadWSReportFiles application. 
 Instructions
Web Service Endpoint - 
ChangeLogReportingSOAP
The web service call used in this example is not the only call that can be used for this test. However, I found it to be the easiest to generate information for, when calling the Web Service and no data is returned.
Calling the Web Service to Create a Zip File using SoapUI
Depending on which devtest server you have deployed your changes to, you will need to update the SOAP endpoint to match the devtest server. Also make sure the biller you are using is pointing to the same domain you are calling the SOAP call on. 
In the example below both are pointing to: 
https://devtest6.invoicecloud.com
If no data is returned no zip file is created! 
ChangeLogReportingSOAP returns change log information when customer data is changed. Making changes on any customer profile, such as an address change, will create logs that will be pulled by the web service when called again.
Verify UploadWSReportFile Processed the Zip file
Check WSReport and WSReportFiles tables against New Relic Logs
Verify the file name created by the web service in New Relic matches whats in WSReportFiles Table.
Verify the file token matches the file name uploaded to the blob storage.
UploadWSReportFiles is a scheduled task and runs every 15 minutes. If there is no entry record for the upload in WSReportFiles you may need to wait several minutes until it runs at a 15 minute interval on the hour.
Check Azure Storage Account:
 
Verify the file was uploaded to the blob storage.
Devtest Azure Storage Account - 
icstratusarchivedevtest 
Drill down to find the uploaded wsReport:
icstratusarchivedevtest → Data Storage → Containers → ic-wsreportfiles → BillerID(2689)
Summary
By following these steps you should be able to test whether UploadWSReportFiles is working correctly.
