Purpose
Currently there are only two options when reversing a transaction, Void and Refund. In both options the full amount of a specific transaction is refunded or voided. When it comes to voiding a transaction it is common practice to void the whole transaction, so no change is necessary with this process. However when refunding a transaction, there is a need to be able to refund portions of the transaction. Therefore a new path, i.e., partial refund, under the refund option is necessary. The partial refund allows the user the capability to refund specific payments of a transaction, and enter different amounts to refund on said payments.
Reverse Transaction Overview
This is the flow diagram for reversing an EMV transaction. There are two main paths, Void and Refund. If the refund conditions are met then the refund path is taken, otherwise we take the void path. When processing a void, the payment is labeled as voided and since it has not been funded i.e., the batch has not been settled, there is no movement of funds.
When processing a refund, there are two options available a partial refund and a full refund. The full refund is exactly what it sounds like, we are reversing all the payments made on invoices for a specific transaction. So the total amount of the transaction is the amount refunded. The partial refund route gives the user the capability to enter different amounts to refund on the payments made on invoices for a specific transaction. If a user does not enter an amount to refund on a invoice payment, then that payment will not be refunded. Thus only a partial refund of the transaction is processed.
