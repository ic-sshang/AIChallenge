Creating a Branch
When creating a branch, please start the Branch Name with the Jira Item Number you are working on followed by a 
/
 and then a short description of the change(s) to make.
Example: 
PLAT-1411/temp-disable-kong-route-deploys
Committing to a Branch
When committing to a branch we want to get in the habit of specifying the 
SemVer
 (GitVer) increment tag in at least one of the commits to the Branch to tell SemVer (not all repos use this yet but we will roll out to Repos in 2025 and 2026) how to calculate the new SemVer Tab Number.
Increment Tag options:
+semver: major
+semver: minor
+semver: patch
