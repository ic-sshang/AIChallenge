Summary
The WaterSmart integration has two parts: Customer Portal SSO and a batch EBPP integration. There are instances where IC is integrated to a biller’s WaterSmart customer portal but is not using the WaterSmart batch EBPP integration (see CRM for biller-specific details).
WaterSmart hosts a customer portal for each biller and serves as the middle-man between the biller's CIS and IC. The biller will give data to WaterSmart and WaterSmart will convert it into the standard integration format to provide data to IC. Similarly, IC will provide a standard file layout for change logs, payments and rejects that WaterSmart will provide to the biller (in the same format or altered by WaterSmart).
