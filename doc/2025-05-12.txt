Pipeline to Run
This one failed with weird App Gateway API Validation error, researching it but it did not cause any failed changes to any Ap Gateway configuration, it was an error in the pre-validation the App Gateway API does to ensure the request provided will run successfully if executed, so no harm.  Still ran all the K6 tests and a run thru of the CRM, Biller, and Payer Portals and all worked, so no impact to App Gateway Routing.  Will try to run again on 2025-05-18 after updating to latest 3.X 
azurerm
 provider and latest Terraform.exe version to see if that fixes the issue (might also be transient).  However the update to the 
output
 was successful, therefore we moved forward with the Observability changes with 
this Pipeline
. 
 
Test Plan
Run the 
App Gateway HealthCheck Tests
 to ensure routing still works as expected
