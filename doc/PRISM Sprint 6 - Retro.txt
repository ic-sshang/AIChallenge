Have early discussions on blockers with the Team instead of spending excessive time on them.
Verify all your changes on DevTest environment before raising draft PR.
Eventually moving out to 3 weeks sprint, 2 (Development) + 1(Testing) model allows for better management, in case of any bugs.
Spending more time on Spike documentation.
Spending time on last minute requirement changes until they are having necessary dependency.
Post DB tasks in the DBA Slack channel instead of following up with the DB engineer.
Owning the Testing tickets
