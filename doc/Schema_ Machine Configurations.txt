The 
Machine Configurations
 object schema exists to document the OS configurations (i.e. Windows features enabled/disabled, system time zone, registry settings, etc.) and 3rd party application installations. Note that we are 
not
 tracking our own software and services in this schema - 
ICDatabaseService v1.2.3
 being installed on a server falls under a different schema.
Reference Types
The reference type 
is configured on
 will be used to relate any number of virtual machines to any CI in the Machine Configurations schema that is installed, configured, or enabled on those servers. For example, if 
New Relic Infrastructure Agent 1.62.0
 is installed on the 10 production web servers, those 10 server objects would be related to the 
New Relic Infrastructure Agent 1.62.0
 object with a reference of type 
is configured on
.
