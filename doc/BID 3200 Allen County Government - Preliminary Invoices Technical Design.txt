File Mapping
Invoice File - Prelims
File Purpose: The purpose of this file is to create preliminary tax bills so that flex pay payments can be applied throughout the tax year (monthly) even though the biller only runs tax bills twice per year.
File Extension:  .BIF
Notes: Prelims will only be created for accounts that have been paid (install 2 invoice balance less than or equal to $0 as of 11/17/2022). We will set balance forward to false.
