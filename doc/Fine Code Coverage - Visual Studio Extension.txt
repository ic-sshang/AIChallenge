Overview
The 
Fine Code Coverage
 extension for Visual Studio is a tool designed to help developers visualize unit test code coverage directly within the Visual Studio environment. Here are some key features and benefits:
Compatibility
: It supports .NET Core and .NET Framework
Visualization
: The extension highlights the code being tested and the code doing the testing, making it easier to identify which parts of your codebase are covered by tests
Reports
: It provides detailed reports, including coverage summaries and risk hotspots, to help you understand the quality and coverage of your tests
Integration
: Fine Code Coverage integrates seamlessly with Visual Studio's Test Explorer, allowing you to run tests and view coverage results within the same interface
Use this tool to provide code coverage feedback locally without Sonarqube integration. 
Download
After installing, the extension will provide coverage metrics on Unit Tests that are run via the Test Explorer
Clicking on a report item will take you to the code file where gutters (green/red) will provide feedback on lines covered and lines not covered.
