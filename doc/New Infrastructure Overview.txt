Purpose
This page provides a high-level view of our Cloud’s core Azure/Terraform infrastructure. This new model is designed to replace those ad-hoc band-aid solutions with a robust, repeatable, and secure platform. This will:
Enable Scalability
 
Decouple compute, cache and data layers  
Allow on-demand growth through modular VM and Redis modules  
Support automated horizontal scaling in future iterations  
Improve Maintainability
 
Enforce a hub-and-spoke network topology for clear isolation  
Use Terraform modules with pinned versions, inputs/outputs and validation  
Apply consistent tagging, naming conventions and documentation  
Harden Security & Compliance
 
Implement private endpoints and DNS zone links to eliminate public ingress  
Leverage Azure RBAC, managed identities, and Key Vault RBAC for secrets  
Apply network ACLs and enforce TLS 1.2+ at every boundary  
Boost Reliability & Resilience
 
Build a clear DR/backup strategy with documented RPO/RTO  
Deploy services across multiple availability zones  
Provide runbooks and automated remediation for common failures  
Drive Observability & Automation
 
Integrate Azure Monitor alerts and dashboards for every resource  
Capture all provisioning steps in a CI/CD pipeline with approval gates  
Maintain a consolidated runbook library to reduce mean-time-to-resolution 
Scope:
This implementation covers all major domains needed for a modern, enterprise-grade platform:
Domain
Key Components
Resource Group & IAM            
RG module, Azure AD group assignments           
Networking (Hub-and-Spoke & DNS)
Hub VNet, Spoke VNet, Private DNS & Endpoints   
Compute (Web VMs)               
VM module, managed identities, OS disk config   
Secrets & Key Vault             
Key Vault RBAC, secret provisioning             
Cache (Azure Redis)             
Redis Cache instances, private endpoints        
External DNS (Cloudflare)       
Cloudflare provider, CNAME record management    
CI/CD & Deployment              
Terraform pipeline (init → plan → apply), approvals 
By defining clear boundaries and responsibilities for each of these domains—and documenting every step end-to-end—we’ll transform our platform from “just-get-it-working” servers into a scalable, secure, and maintainable foundation for future growth.
