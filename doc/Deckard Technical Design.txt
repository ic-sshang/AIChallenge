Invoice Cloud Web Services
Deckard
 integrate with 
InvoiceCloud
 using 
CloudPaymentV2
. This integration allows customers to access InvoiceCloud’s payment portal through 
Deckard 
platform when apply license and payment. The information in the Invoice Cloud Web Services section reflects the information given to Invoice Cloud at the time of Discovery and Design. It is possible for this information to be updated at any time by a biller or CIS Vendor without notifying Invoice Cloud.

Cloud Payments V2
Purpose/Summary: This web service based payment integration allows 3rd party applications to utilize a "Pay Now" button within their application to redirect the user to the Invoice Cloud Payment Route where they can enter in all the payment information and submit the payment. Once the payment has been approved, the IC Payment Route will display a printable receipt and provide a method to return the user back to the calling application.

User Interaction and Design
Data Flow - Payment
Payments are made in the backend with REST Webservice calls with InvoiceCloud. GeoCivix is the owner of the UI/UX. 
Data Flow - Void
Voids will be processed through Biller Portal if needed.
Data Flow - ACH Reject
ACH Rejects can be reviewed through the Biller Portal. 
Payer Experience
Payers will process payments on the GeoCivix website. The payment portal will not have any InvoiceCloud verbiage as all payments will be processed in the backend. The data will be entered in GeoCivix and sent to InvoiceCloud via webservice.
