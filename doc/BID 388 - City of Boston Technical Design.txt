Quarterly Upload Process
Boston will send 
RE
 and 
PP
 invoice files in zip folders through secure upload. This should be sent to us prior to the next delivery date.
They requested to have us test converting the file and upload them to Boston Test Portal (498).
:warning:
atlassian-warning
#DEEBFF
If the BIF conversions fail, a change request will need to be submitted and the work done through an INT item.
Boston will then review 
templates 
on the test portal and approve the upload to production.
:warning:
atlassian-warning
#DEEBFF
Any changes to the templates will need to be submitted through a change request for Bill Presentment. Template changes should be prioritized as we’ll need to deploy these while we can upload a locally converted BIF. (After Boston’s Approval)
A day will be picked to upload the files to production on either the closest work day to the 
1st
 or on the 
1st 
as soon as possible.
The files can be uploaded through one of the methods:
If no changes are needed to BIFs:
Upload through Boston’s FTP or local Stratus Tasks.
If any changes are needed to BIFs:
Convert the raw file locally and upload it as 
InvoiceCloud BIF File
 through Boston's FTP or local Status tasks.
Recommended to locally convert to BIF and then drop them in an FTP task in Boston’s Portal for faster upload.
The First Notification Date will need to be deactivated during new uploads to both test and production portals. 
The date will come from Boston close to the production upload. This can be updated in the CRM after uploads (or in BIF customizations if the date is known ahead of time but will need to be deactivated for the next quarter).
 
The process is a work in progress toward more automation for timed uploads.
Sufficient time to work on changes in BIFs/Templates to be fully deployed is preferred.
