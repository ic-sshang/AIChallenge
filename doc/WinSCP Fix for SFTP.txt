WinSCP FIX – AZURE SFTP over port 2022
If a user is connecting over SFTP using WinSCP please make sure they disable this feature in the GUI
Disable the feature in WinSCP
WinSCP has a setting enabled by default that transfers files larger than 100kb to a temporary file name (with the 
.filepart
 extension) and then renames the file. The original file transfer is being recognized as an upload and it’s moving the file before WinSCP has a chance to rename the file. The easiest fix is to disable this feature in WinSCP.
The feature can be disabled in WinSCP:
Click 
Options > Preferences
.
In the 
Preferences
 dialog box, click to expand the 
Transfer 
node, then click 
Endurance
.
Under 
Enable transfer resume/transfer to temporary filename for
, click 
Disable
.
Click 
OK 
to save the changes.
