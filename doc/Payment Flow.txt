Regression Testing Update
Regression testing focuses on end-to-end (E2E) testing for payments and batch closes. Here are the key points:
Demo Terminal Payments
:
When processing a payment using a demo terminal, the API calls do not reach the ICGateway.
This ensures no data is stored in the production gateway database during testing.
Live Terminal Payments
:
If the terminal is set to live, the API calls will hit the ICGateway.
This will store data in the production gateway database, which will affect our production ledger.
Important Note
: Testing with a live terminal should be done with caution to avoid unintended impacts on the production environment. For test automation, we now need to test ICGateway through another area, such as the UAT environment.
