 Can have a higher upfront and ongoing cost compared to Auth0 or self-hosted Keycloak.
 
PingID
PingID integrates well with .NET applications through the PingFederate server, which acts as either an Identity Provider (IdP) or a Service Provider (SP). The .NET Integration Kit includes tools like the OpenToken Adapter and a .NET agent, allowing seamless communication of user attributes between .NET-based web applications and PingFederate
. This setup is particularly useful for enterprises needing strong multi-factor authentication (MFA) and single sign-on (SSO) capabilities
Auth0
Auth0 provides several SDKs tailored for different types of .NET applications, including 
http://ASP.NET
  Core and Web API
. Auth0's SDKs support various authentication and authorization features, such as JWT middleware for token validation
. Auth0 is known for its ease of use, extensive documentation, and flexibility in integrating with different .NET versions and frameworks
Comparison
Ease of Integration
: Auth0 generally offers a more straightforward integration process with comprehensive documentation and examples
Features
: PingID excels in enterprise-level MFA and SSO solutions, while Auth0 provides a wide range of authentication and authorization features suitable for various application types.
Flexibility
: Auth0 supports multiple .NET frameworks and versions, making it highly adaptable.
Assumed TCO
Medium to high TCO
, justified by:
Strong security capabilities.
Flexibility in deployment.
Reduced engineering effort due to drag-and-drop workflow design.
Best suited for 
security-conscious mid to large enterprises
.
Higher Direct Subscription Costs:
 Ongoing subscription fees based on usage.
Lower Indirect Costs:
 Reduced need for infrastructure management, patching, and dedicated security expertise for the identity platform.
Faster Time-to-Market:
 Simplified setup and configuration can lead to quicker deployment.
Scalability Included:
 Auth0 handles the scalability of the identity platform.
Potentially Highest TCO:
 Can involve significant licensing fees and the cost of implementing and managing a comprehensive enterprise IAM solution.
Value for Complex Requirements:
 The TCO can be justified for organizations with stringent security, compliance, and integration needs.
Expertise Required:
 May require specialized expertise for implementation and management.

Extensive API:
 Well-documented Management API and Authentication API for seamless integration.
Enterprise Integration Focus:
 SDKs and integration tools are often geared towards enterprise-level integration and may have a steeper learning curve for simpler scenarios.  
Standard Protocol Support:
 Robust support for SAML, OAuth, and OIDC.  
PingFederate Integration (Optional):
 For advanced federation scenarios, integration with PingFederate is a key aspect.
Focus on Policy Enforcement:
 Developer integration often revolves around enforcing centrally managed access policies.
  
Compatibility with .NET Web Applications
Full support for ASP.NET and
 
ASP.NET Core applications.

.
Auth0 generally offers the smoothest and most developer-friendly experience for integrating with .NET web applications due to its dedicated and well-supported .NET SDK. This can lead to faster development times and reduced complexity.
Ping ID (with PingOne) also relies on standard protocols for .NET integration and is well-suited for enterprises with complex IAM requirements. However, the integration might be more involved and geared towards enforcing centrally managed policies, potentially requiring more configuration in your .NET application.
