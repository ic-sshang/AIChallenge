Overview


The Add on post live phase consists of monitoring the Biller’s service to confirm that payments are being made successfully and functionality is as expected. This can include any follow up needed from functionality that is not as expected, ensuring a quality deliverable. The transition to Client Services support happens during this phase and the Add on is fully moved to completed. The Delivery (Add on) Team does not provide post go live support.
