Authentication details from Chase
To use OAuth 2.0 authentication for testing environment access, perform the following steps. The rest of the article provides detailed instructions on each step.
Generate a certificate
 signing request (CSR) or certificate using either the 
J.P. Morgan authentication utility
 or 
OpenSSL
, and provide the CSR/cert to your J.P. Morgan Payments Representative via email. Your J.P. Morgan Payments Representative then provides your client ID, resource ID, token Uniform Resource Indicator (URI), and certificate (if you provided a CSR).
Use your private key and certificate to sign a JSON Web Token (JWT).
Send a request to the J.P. Morgan Token URI to 
create an access token
, which is valid for 8 hours.
Use the access token to 
send requests
 to the Commerce platform testing environment endpoints.
Repeat steps 1-3 to access the Commerce platform production environment endpoints.
Following the details from Chase this is the proposed Token Flow:
