Key outcomes
Vista Hackathon
The 2025 Vista Hackathon will focus on creating generative AI-powered agents. Participants will develop applications that are themselves intelligent agents: autonomous or semiautonomous systems that use generative AI to perceive, reason and act. We encourage teams to focus on customer-facing product innovations, though other applications of agentic AI may also be submitted.
