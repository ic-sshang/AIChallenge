File Imports – Email Updates
Imports update email addresses for Account Owners that should not be updated
Invoice imports update emails differently depending on CRM options (Biller Option 108)
Admin/BIF imports lack oversight.
Need to get research on how many billers use the BIF to update existing email address
Need an import tool specific to email imports or updates – behavior needs to be defined
If email address is the username you can’t do this without validating

Account Linking/Unlinking
Email changes cascade to all logins tied to linked accounts; the login has the email address, so if you change it, it will change for any account the login is tied to. This is intended behavior that might need to be re-defined.
Not sure how we can resolve this.  A single login is what drive the link and an update would be on that login and reflected where login details are displayed.
Could be solved by using a ownership transfer.  The new account would hold the new email address
Unclear on the problem - seems to be intended behavior
Account Linking/Unlinking
Changes to default payment method apply to all linked accounts; where the login payment method is being used only
Needs more research / testing in the UI
Unclear on the problem - seems to be intended behavior

Paperless is at the Account Level and cannot be set by individual users
If the landlord wants a paper bill and the tenant does not and both are Owners on the account, and Paperless is selected by either that will be the setting for the entire account and no one receives a paper bill. 
Note: This can be an issue with CIS integration partners as well. Bill Print vendor costs. Do we send 3 paper bills to the same address scenario
Need to research
Should align with CIS/integrations – connect with Albert & team
If you are the one who registers Paperless, only you can edit it in the future?

Account Linking/Unlinking
Accounts are sometimes linked improperly.
Accounts remain linked after unregistration processes and users can gain access to accounts that do not belong to them (Scenario is with AUS + Wichita + SSO)

Registration (API)
The REST Register Custom API call used by SSOs to register an account responds with a “Customer already exists” error message without actually registering the customer. 
Update API call so that SSO registration overwrites the 
temp login

No logging exists in the biller portal Customer History or the CRM customer history for username changes. This makes troubleshooting around issues with username changes extremely difficult.
Add username change logging.

Inconsistent Behavior
Biller Option 43
 “
REMOVED - Biller Portal - Remove Email Address
” in the Biller Portal no longer works as originally intended. It is now controlled by Biller Portal permissions.
Option 43 should be operational in the CRM and it should override any Biller portal permissions able to be set by the Biller.
If Option 43 is enabled, no Biller Portal users should be able to remove email address. 
If Option 43 is not enabled, the option is available based on Biller Portal user perms.

This is NOT related to MCL and is a Biller user perm. Need to discuss with Biller team and CSM or Alliance manager involved.

Biller Option 42 “
Biller Portal - Edit Email Address
” behavior changed and prevents Billers from updating both the email address and courtesy email address from being edited.
Option 42
 should prevent only the primary email address on an account from being editable and it should override any biller portal permission for editing the primary email address field.
