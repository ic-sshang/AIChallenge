This article contains topics related to the team’s Infrastructure as Code (IaC) designs and decisions.
The team uses Terraform as the IaC configuration language and engine.  The Terraform configurations are intended to be ran from an Azure DevOps Pipeline utilizing a 
remote state
 file hosted in Terraform Cloud workspaces, a unique 
remote state
 and workspace per unique environment and deployment cycle combination.
Terraform Development Guidelines
Reduce the configuration burden to reduce the likelihood of misconfigurations between environments.
Minimize variable complexity.
Model purpose driven architectures within the terraform repos.
Encapsulate the complexities of the architecture.
Provide descriptions for all variables.
Provide examples, defaults, and validations for variables when possible.
Allow for easy extensibility of the architecture.
Enable immutable infrastructure deployment patterns.
Azure DevOps Terraform Flow Template
InvoiceCloud has created an Azure DevOps Template to be used in CI/CD Pipelines enabling consistent deployment strategies for Terraform managed Azure Resources.  A link to the template is below.
