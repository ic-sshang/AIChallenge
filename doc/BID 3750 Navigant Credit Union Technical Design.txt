Payment/Lockbox File
File Summary/Purpose: The purpose of this file is transfer payment data from IC to the biller
File Extension: .swm
File Naming Convention:  
TCBS135301I.1353.PYIC.YYYYMMDD.SWM
Specification: The SWIM II file format has acceptable values for the code fields that are listed below.
These files are 154-character fixed-length records. They contain only detail records.
Included Payment Types: Only Payments
Sample File:
SFTP File Path:  /navigantcreditunion/FromInvoiceCloud/Payments
File Transfer Frequency: 
Payment File to be created every day
IMPORTANT: 
Each payment will be added twice to the payment file so they will have two lines. Both lines will be the same for the payment except for the “Transaction Code”. First line will have the payment with “XPMT” and the second line for the same payment will have a “GLD” as the “Transaction Code”. For the second line with “GLD” transaction code, the Account Number will always be “753209520”.
PS: This is just how Fiserv’s payment file format is. They need to receive the payment in one line and then remove it from their bank with the second line. There is no special reason for this so it does not matter for Invoice Cloud.
