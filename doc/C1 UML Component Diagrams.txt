C1 UML component diagrams are used to model the high level (primary) components of a system and their relationships but not the individual details of a given component.   C1 diagrams are used to visualize the overall architecture and interactions of a system.  C1 diagrams should be created for new projects.  New projects that involve existing systems can be used to help backfill the documentation catalog for C1 diagrams for systems found at
