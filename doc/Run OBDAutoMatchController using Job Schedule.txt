If the Job Schedule has not been updated to use the newest controller then please refer to previous sections regarding updating the Job Schedule after a new controller deploy has taken place.
Enable Job Schedule
To run the controller, make sure that the state of the controller is “Active”. You can right-click on the job schedule, to Enable it.
You can also Enable the Job Schedule by clicking into the Job Schedule and in overview click enable.
Set Start Time
Under Schedule you can set the Do not run until time. This will allow you to set when you want the job to run. The soonest you can set this time is 5 minutes from your current time. Once that is set, it will kick off the OBDAutomatchController job at that time.
