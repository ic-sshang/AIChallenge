Scripts
Pandas
This is a script you can use with pandas to merge two csv files together. You have three options on how to retrieve the data, 
'both'
, 
'left_only'
, and 
'right_only'
 after the merge.
It is helpful for both non-MCL and MCL, as you can use this to also retrieve data from the DB and merge it with the file you’re merging with as well.
Merge Data Script
py
import pandas as pd

origFile = pd.read_csv(r"FILE1",
                       dtype=str, keep_default_na=False)
customerGuidFile = pd.read_csv(r"FILE2",
                               dtype=str, keep_default_na=False)

df = pd.DataFrame(data=origFile)
df2 = pd.DataFrame(data=customerGuidFile)

#you can merge based on multiple columns. useful.
res = df.merge(df2, left_on=["AccountNumber"], right_on=["AccountNumber"], 
                              how="left", indicator=True, sort=False)
#res = res.drop_duplicates(keep="first", subset=['AccountNumber']) #drops all but first copy; not always needed but on request by the biller

dfs = {k: v for k, v in res.groupby("_merge")}
res2 = dfs['both'].drop(['_merge'], axis=1)
res2.to_csv(r"OUTPUTFILE", index=False)
Login Creation Script
py
import pandas as pd
import uuid
file = pd.read_csv(r"INPUT_FILE",
                          dtype=str, keep_default_na=False)
df = pd.DataFrame(columns=['AccountNumber', 'UserName', 'Password'])
madeDict = {}

for ind ifile. Indexex:
    accountNumber = str(file['AccountNumber'][ind])
    userName = str(file['Username/Email Address'][ind])

    if not userName or userName.isspace():
        userName = 'AutoPay_' + accountNumber

    if userName in madeDict.keys():
        password = madeDict[userName]
    else:
        password = uuid.uuid4()
        madeDict[userName] = password
    new_row = {'AccountNumber': accountNumber, 'UserName': userName, 'Password': password}
    df.loc[len(df)] = new_row
print(df['AccountNumber'].duplicated().any())
df.to_csv(r"OUTPUT_FILE", index=False)
File Splitter Script
py
import pandas as pd

file= pd.read_csv(rf"INPUT_FILE",
                  dtype=str, keep_default_na=False, encoding='mac_roman')

df = pd.DataFrame(data=file)

for i, g in df.groupby(df.index // 1000):
    g.to_csv(rf"OUTPUT_FILE_{i}", index=False)
SQL
This is a call you’ll want to use if you’re trying to find out if there are any accounts that are registered, or to change if you’re doing a MCL conversion and are trying to grab LoginGUIDs.
sql
SELECT c.AccountNumber, l.*
FROM mcl.customerlogins AS cl
INNER JOIN mcl.logins AS l
ON l.loginid = cl.loginid
INNER JOIN customers AS c
ON c.customerid = cl.customerid
Proposed Solutions
Further restrict secure upload access blob to lower the need of file encryption before upload.
Require following a standard file formatting, and charge billers if they need a “white-glove” service to massage the data.
There was a suggestion made to either have the customer support team handle this, or for a services company to do the work.
Reopen the import tool for IMs after confirming the tool is in a self-serviceable state for them.
