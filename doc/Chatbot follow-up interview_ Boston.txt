Call brief
Matthew, Matt, Joel and Ryan from Invoice Cloud, along with Jack from Boston, City of, discussed the potential use of a chatbot to enhance the city's payment experience and support channels. Jack initially expressed skepticism towards chatbots but acknowledged the evolution of AI, and the group explored ways to integrate a chatbot that could provide a seamless payment flow, escalate to live agents when needed, and leverage the city's existing knowledge base and support structure to deliver an effective customer experience.
Key points
Invoice Cloud is developing a chatbot solution for billers to embed on their websites to help customers make payments without navigating away.
Jack has an "anti-chatbot bias" based on past experiences, but acknowledges AI has improved since then.
The chatbot is focused on simple payment flows and providing escalation to live agents for more complex issues.
Feedback was provided on improving the credit card entry flow and providing more context/assurance to the user.
The team discussed the potential for a "warm handoff" to a live agent if the user needs further assistance.
Jack shared concerns about the complexity of integrating the chatbot with the City of Boston's contact center.
The team discussed the need to work closely with each biller to build the chatbot's knowledge base and escalation process.
The City of Boston has an open policy on experimenting with AI, but changes would need to go through their digital team.
Success for the chatbot would depend on addressing known support challenges, like high volume or inconsistent answers.
The team plans to follow up with the City of Boston's collections team to learn more about their support needs.
