Heading
Feedback on Header
It would be helpful to have more flexibility and control over the heading component's typography settings—specifically the ability to customize the 
font size
, 
font family
, 
font weight & font color
.
2.
MuiTable
Feedback on MuiTable
The current design of the MuiTable component appears to be tightly coupled with the AI Report Generator, which limits its reusability in other contexts.
The 
table footer is always rendered
, even when it's not needed, and there’s no option to disable or remove it.
There is 
no built-in support for rendering checkboxes as table rows
, which restricts customization for interactive or selectable table elements.
3.
Checkbox
Feedback on Checkbox
The Checkbox component currently lacks customization options for its appearance. Specifically, it would be beneficial to allow control over the 
tick-mark color
 and the 
background color
, to better align with different design themes and branding requirements.
4.
Filter
Feedback on Filter
It would be valuable to introduce a 
Filter component
 in the design system. This is especially needed in scenarios where data is displayed in a grid format—such as 
Open Invoices
, 
Closed Invoices
, or 
Payment History
—to allow users to easily filter and navigate through the data.
Loaders/skeleton
Feedback on Loaders/Skeleton
A 
Skeleton or Loader component
 would be a valuable addition to the design system. It is especially useful during 
UI loading states
, helping to improve user experience by indicating that content is being fetched or processed.
