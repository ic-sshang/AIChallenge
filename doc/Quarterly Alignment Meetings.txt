Scrum teams align monthly with Product & Engineering leadership to understand what’s being worked on, what the team is planning, and how we can better execute together. 
Staying aligned helps us ensure we are executing against company strategy, are better able to forecast releases to the rest of the organization (and our customers!), and keep the rest of the company excited and energized about what we’re shipping.
