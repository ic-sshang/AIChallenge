File Mapping
Invoice File
File Summary/Purpose: The purpose of this file is transfer bill/invoice data to IC from the biller. PCI billers provide IC a ‘full file’ on a daily basis that includes all accounts in their system. This file is used to split into the following: new invoices, balance adjustments, customer updates (block ACH and block CC) and conveyance.
File Extension:  CSV
File Naming Convention: PortalExport.csv
File Delimiter: Comma(,)
Specification: n/a
Sample File: 
SFTP File Path: ToInvoiceCloud\Invoices\
File Transfer Frequency: Daily
File Format Name: IF_PCI Invoices_V2 - RE / PP
File Split Details: IC splits one file into 4 - invoices, adjustments, customer updates and conveyance. The ‘SFTP File Path’ is where the raw file is placed by the biller and the file split details shows where each of the 4 files are placed when they are ready for import. 
InvoiceCloud SFTP File Path - Invoices : ToInvoiceCloud\Invoices\Split
Note: The biller uploads a file with 46 columns.  When the invoice file runs through Biller File Split, a calculated field for the Biller Invoice Type is added to the end of each invoice record making the file have 47 columns.  When it is ready to process with SWS, the additional column tells SWS what IC Invoice Type to assign the invoice too.

Block Payments
This setting is used to block customers depending on their account status (Custom48). For example, if the customer has account status = L, we will only block the customer from making payments if L exist in BlockCCCodes. 
With this functionality, we are able to use the block codes from the biller to block customers.
Ex1. BLOCKCC(L,R)|BLOCKEFT(T,P,R,Q)
Ex2. BLOCKCC(D,A)|BLOCKEFT(E)
Ex3. BLOCKCC(A,V,C,D,E,G)
Ex4. BLOCKEFT(7A,4G,8I)
BLOCKCC(<Insert_BlockCCCode_Here>)|BLOCKEFT(<Insert_BlockEFTCode_Here>)
NOTE: You can use just either one BLOCKCC, BLOCKEFT or both keywords to block payments. The keyword is BLOCKCC and BLOCKEFT which uses paranethesis to enclose the codes in. More than one code can be added by adding a comma.

JSON Configuration
This setting is used to configure what would otherwise be hardcoded values for new PCI Billers
JSON Configuration is started by creating a 
“PCI”
 object.
The
 “PCI” 
object contains two properties 
“InvConfigs” 
and 
“SupportedInvTypes”
“InvConfigs”
 contains an array of Invoice Configurations each containing four properties:
“InvTypeIdentifier”
 - an array of Strings for each PCI Invoice Type Identifier (field 46)
“ICInvType”
 - a String of the Invoice Cloud Invoice Type for the configuration
“Prefix”
 - a String of the prefix to be used for creating Account and Invoice Number
Note: must include a dash “-” if needed
“PCIInvType”
 - a String of PCI Invoice Type (field 18) for this specific invoice configuration
“SupportedInvTypes”
 - an array of Strings for each PCI Invoice Type that will be supported
Note: this list must include inv types configured in InvConfigs above to be supported
Example Configuration:
{"PCI": {
    "InvConfigs": [{
        "InvTypeIdentifier": ["P","B"],
        "ICInvTypeID": "7",
        "Prefix": "PP-",
        "PCIInvoiceTypeID": "5"},
        {
        "InvTypeIdentifier": ["R"],
        "ICInvTypeID": "8",
        "Prefix": "RE-",
        "PCIInvoiceTypeID": "9"}],
    "SupportedInvTypes":["5","9", "61", "63", "64", "65", "69", "70", "74", "76", "78", "79"]}
}
Condensed:
{"PCI": {
    "InvConfigs": [{
    "InvTypeIdentifier": ["P","B"],"ICInvTypeID": "7","Prefix": "PP-","PCIInvoiceTypeID": "5"},{
    "InvTypeIdentifier": ["R"],"ICInvTypeID": "8","Prefix": "RE-","PCIInvoiceTypeID": "9"}],

Block ACH and Block CC values were hardcoded
Allow Block ACH and Block CC values to be configurable per biller
Each biller can configure their own AccountStatus values in PCI and will have different Block ACH and Block CC markers (ex: Biller A may use R and L / Biller B may use T and C)

No customer update in integration design
Use the Customer Update File (CUF) to update block payment flags (CC and ACH)
When a customer is blocked for ACH and/or CC payments in PCI after the initial invoice is created, a CUF will be created to update these flags in IC.
