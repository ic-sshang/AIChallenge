Random Thoughts/Music Request
Prioritize the work that is assigned to you. If you have time then, assist the team, if the team is good and you are on track, then you can assist other teams. (Time management) +1
Picking up items that need testing when available +2
Stay aware on the progress and timing of roadmap epics. +2
Self-documentation and BCP (Best cowboy practices). +1
Don’t be scared to recommend or improve something, bring it up in a meeting and we can go over it and turn it into a project or an item. +1
Research When Asked To - Let the person who is supposed to research the item do their part first before getting involved.
You’ll be wasting time if you researched an item that was supposed to be researched by you.
Stop holding items that need to go out for small improvements that can be done later or in another item.
Working Remote - Working from a car is not good. Be comfortable. Have good signal. Be safe.
Keep working on how to facilitate automation.
On-call responsibilities - When you’re on call continue to: 
Review the ITG board for new items
Dabble a bit in Guru by creating or updating cards
Spikes and Research items are your friends
Do not forget about documentation meeting at least once a week.
Keep learning by picking up items that you aren’t familiar with. +2
Staying on Top of Due Dates - Just because you are getting your item through the sprint doesn’t mean you shouldn’t worry about the biller/partner/printer’s agreement and their timeline. 
Expect the unexpected 
 
Super Bowl was lame. 
 
Unexpect the expected #Deep +deep
Kendrick Lamar had a great performance (RIP Drake)

 Get daily coffee dose +1 -1 (take a break sometimes, coffee could become an addiction) -1 I want to  be addicted to coffee (I don’t drink any lol) +1 If I pass away one day, I just wanted to be on a caffeine overdose. +99999
