Plugin docs: 
OAuth 2.0 Authentication - Plugin | Kong Docs
The OAuth2 plugin can easily be applied at either or both the service (entire upstream / backend / microservice) and route (only on one specific endpoint) scope. To do this, in your tfvars file, add the following section to your route or service:
oauth2 = {
  config_json = "plugins/oauth2.json" # this should be the path to your plugin's config file
}
Here it is in context:
kong_route_configurations = {
  httpbin = {
    backend_targets         = ["httpbin.org:443"]
    backend_path            = "/anything/kong/to/httpbin"
    healthcheck_active_path = "/anything/kong/to/httpbin"
    routes = {
      default = {
        incoming_protocols = ["https", "http"]
        incoming_hosts = [
          "api-dev.invoicecloud-beta.com"
        ]
        incoming_paths         = ["/httpbin/v1"]
        incoming_strip_path    = true
        incoming_preserve_host = false
        plugins = {
          request_transformer_advanced = {
            config_json = "plugins/httpbin-transformer.json"
          }
          oauth2 = {
            config_json = "plugins/oauth2.json"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
Here’s the simple configuration I used to test the oauth2 plugin:
{
    "enable_client_credentials": true
}
As you can see, I applied the plugin to the default route for httpbin. Once applied, when you try to hit the API, you get the following error:
curl -i -X GET \
 'https://api-dev.invoicecloud-beta.com/httpbin/v1/get'

# response:
# {
#   "error_description": "The access token is missing",
#   "error": "invalid_request"
# }
The backend service, httpbin, has no authentication of its own. The oauth2 plugin is adding authentication as a requirement. As part of that, some routes get added to the endpoint where you’ve added the plugin.
/oauth2/authorize
The endpoint to the Authorization Server that provisions authorization codes for the 
Authorization Code
 flow, or the access token when the 
Implicit Grant
 flow is enabled. Only 
POST
 is supported.
/oauth2/token
The endpoint to the Authorization Server that provision access tokens. This is also the only endpoint to use for the 
Client Credentials
 and 
Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant
 flows. Only 
POST
 is supported.
/oauth2_tokens
The endpoint to the Authorization Server that allows creating new tokens. Useful on migrations (see below).
/oauth2_tokens/:token_id
The endpoint to the Authorization Server that allows reading, modifying and deleting access tokens.
Now that we’ve applied the plugin, we need to provide a token to authenticate so that we can access our service. But where do we get a token? Hitting one of those new endpoints will do it. Assumes you already created a consumer in Kong and grabbed creds for it; will add details on how to go about doing that later.
curl -i -X POST \
   -H "Content-Type:application/json" \
   -d \
'{
  "client_id": "Z0Wqr6wLFA2N8kcpGVmagu337BBTVL8T", 
  "client_secret": "0SKkC8lQR3wHs6YZiJJH4SG2zQng5nCc", 
  "grant_type": "client_credentials"
}
' \
 'https://api-dev.invoicecloud-beta.com/httpbin/v1/oauth2/token'
 
# reponse:
# {
#   "token_type": "bearer",
#   "expires_in": 7200,
#   "access_token": "FK9NjZRRfm8a0QyW9E6dk8AtcU44VjXX"
# }
Now, we’ve got our token! Let’s use it to authenticate so that we can finally hit our API.
curl -i -X GET \
   -H "Authorization:Bearer FK9NjZRRfm8a0QyW9E6dk8AtcU44VjXX" \
   'https://api-dev.invoicecloud-beta.com/httpbin/v1/get'
Pretty simple – we just provide the bearer token as an auth header, and we’re set! Here’s the response from httpbin, which is just parroting back what we sent it. You can see that some headers get added to the request as it traverses through Kong. For example, 
X-Consumer-Username
 shows you the name of our consumer defined in Kong.

Other notes:
You can add scopes in the plugin config if you want to use them in your application
Seems like if you set something in the config, then remove it, it may not actually get returned to the default value in Kong – you may need to provide explicit values once you’ve set it once. Observed this behavior; seems like a provider bug
