The biller has the option to implement template or PDF extraction
Template for invoice presentment requires an Invoice Format GUID will be generated by IC for each template designed for that customer. Usually there is only one, but the integration can support more than one if needed.
For PDF Extraction (e.g SmartBill), the Invoice Format GUID will always be the same GUID, “B3D8E0C6-0A66-4566-BD1F-480C87121EA6”
