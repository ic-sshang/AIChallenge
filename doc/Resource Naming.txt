Use Nouns for Resources:
RESTful URIs should refer to resources as things (nouns) rather than actions (verbs). For example:
Correct: 
/users
, 
/products
, 
/orders
Avoid: 
/getUsers
, 
/createProduct
, 
/updateOrder
Use Plural Nouns:
Resource names should be plural to align with the REST architectural style.
Correct: 
/users
, 
/products
Avoid: 
/user
, 
/product
Avoid Deep Nesting:
Keep the resource hierarchy shallow to improve usability and maintainability.
Correct: 
/customers/{customerId}/orders
Avoid: 
/customers/{customerId}/orders/{orderId}/items/{itemId}
Be Descriptive:
Use meaningful names that convey the purpose of the resource.
Correct: 
/products/{productId}
, 
/categories/{categoryId}
Avoid: 
/p1
, 
/c2
