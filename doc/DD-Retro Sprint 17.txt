Random Thoughts
Play music during retros and take requests.
Not adding acceptance criteria in grooming.
Diligent code reviews and testing
We might need a simpler way to test Data Pump in production. I was thinking about maybe setting up a simple function app to act as the SP’s endpoint.
It would be helpful,  if sprint grooming items are shared at least a day in advance for better understanding of Jira story/bug
Checking triage board after standup with team
We didn’t have as many “emergency” work items added.
Formalize triaging new file type items to SA before moving to sprint
Action Items
- 
Carry over items
Research item to discover way to be able to insert ACHRejects and Chargebacks in production for testing/smoke testing
