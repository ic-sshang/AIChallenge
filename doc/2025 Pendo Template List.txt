A/B Testing & Reporting
We want to continue to A/B test on all of our Pendo messages to billers or payers as a requirement
A/B test ensures that there is a control group to measure the statistical significance of those payers that viewed the message and those that did not
We should be doing A/B testing on all Pendos to determine
efficacy of message,
the behavior it drives after they see it or if they don't see it until an action has been taken
