How do   Agents access and use the system today?
 How will this functionality be done on Invoice Cloud:  (Biller Portal, AgentConnect, CPV2)?
 
How do CSRs access and use the system today?
(Biller Portal, Virtual Site, AgentConnect CPV2)?
Can agents process payments by using a customer's stored payment method?
One-time Payment URL from AgentConnect does not show stored payments unless you are using CPV2 with Auth Token. 
 
Do  agents assist customers with self service activities like Paperless / Autopay / Pay by Text? If so, please explain:
 If so AgentConnect can trigger an SMS
 
Do some  agents need different permissions than others? (please explain)
 
 
Do  agents accept payments at the counter (in-person)? 
 Encourage “No”
 
IF YES:
Review options in biller portal/ Cloud Pay V2
 
Do you use a separate system/software for counter payments and if so what software? 
 
 
When accepting credit card payments, is a card reader used?  EMV or Swipe?
 
 
Do agents need to act on the behalf of the policyholder for payments? 
Does the agency pay with their own agency payment method (using the Agents bank to pay a policy of an insured customer)? 
If yes, consider using Agent Connect with a LoginGUID and user role of Account Oversight or Group Oversight.  
Remote Authentication API must be used to register the agency in a specified user role.
In order to prevent long lists of linked accounts (register), it is recommended to link the account to the user and unlink (unregister) after the transaction is complete.  
Are there other legacy systems still processing payments if so what is the volume of these records ?

General Questions
 Internal Notes
  
Response/Decision
Date
How do your insured make payments today?
Can you demo how 
insured 
make payments today?  
How do your insured access the payment system today?
 
What are all the payment methods accepted for IC implementation ?
 
What are the payment methods which are required to be converted over from current processor to IC ( if so what is the record count)  ?
What additional payment features are important to your Account team to increase adoption?
 
 
Do You have Single Sign On capabilities or will you be using Invoice Cloud Customer Portal? 
 
 
If SSO, do you have a Identity Provider for SAML SSO or will you be using SSOConnect?
Is multi-user needed?  
Are the additional users co-owners (LoginType 5), or Oversight (LoginTypes 3&4).  For Plan Administration, consider LoginType 4 - Group Oversight - as well as how Option 122 should be configured.  Group Oversight should stay registered even if the policyholder is unregistered.  The Remote Authentication can be used to register these accounts.
What part of the user experience will be through your UI and what part of the User experience will be through Invoice Cloud?
 
 
How will existing users be migrated?
 
 
Do you need to link accounts?
 
 Multiple accounts for one user

Invoice Types
Internal Notes
Response/Decision
Date
Invoice Type/Business Type
Examples:  Premium (monthly policy payment), Membership (some insurance companies require a membership fee to get a policy with them - charged annually).  
If Multiple types, can services be billed separately?
Do customers receive one invoice with multiple policies or separate invoices?  If not on the same invoice, separate invoice types are needed
Invoice Functionality
Internal Notes
Response/Decision
Date
How often are bills produced?
Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, Semi-Annually, Annually etc.
IC Biller Invoice File (BIF) 
preferred method
Review Specs
Integrator File (if not using IC BIF)
Review Specs
Is there an indicator in the file for each service type?
These will be separate invoice types in IC
How is Integrator File Formatted?
XML, CSV, Pipe, Print Spool, etc.
How are changes made to an existing bill?  Is there a separate file for updates to an existing bill?
For example, need to modify due date, notification dates, auto-pay date, etc.
How can IC tell if it is a new invoice Vs a change to an existing invoice.
Based on the fields that need to be updated, this might require a BIF or IUF.
Are you able to customize data sent in the files?
If a change is needed to a custom file, can this be done?
Tell us about how your quote system works and the issuance process of quotes/policies
 Invoice
 
Tell us about how you handle your cancellation and rewrite process? Does a new Policy/Account/Invoice gets created for the insured? 
How are quote payments captured?  Is the billing account number or policy number known at this time? 
If yes, consider creating the account before a BIF arrives or creating one on the fly.  If no, consider using the Customer Renewal function later to move the Quote Number over to the actual billing/policy number.
How are renewals handled - will the billing system call our Customer Renewal API? (i.e., does the policy/account number change every policy term? If so, call the API)
Do you bill Audit Invoices to your policy holders? If so, is this a separate invoice from the premium invoice and would you like these to be payable via autopay?

Does your system produce unique invoice numbers?
If yes, are these numbers printed on bills, would customers recognize these numbers? If no, what combination of values can we use to create a unique number per invoice?
How are balances calculated per invoice? (Explain Balance Forward and Open Billing)
total balance on most recent invoice or balance available on multiple invoices
Are fees (late fees, penalties, interest, etc.) added to the invoice or the account?
Do you have a field for Past Due balances?
Are there any Duplicate invoices?
     If yes, which bill should IC import?
Is there a minimum required payment amount different than the current monthly balance?
This is typically the balance due and not used in Insurance.
Account/Policy Numbers
Internal Notes
Response/Decision
Date
Are Account/Policy Numbers unique per person? (Do you have customer numbers?)
How is billing handled? Policy Based, Account Based or Both? 
This is used to decide on what the IC unique identifier/account number will be.  If Policy based,  we typically use the Policy as the account number.
Under what circumstances would Account Numbers change?
Account numbers might change if they are renewed.  If its the same person we suggest linking accounts or using customer renewal API.
Do you expire previous bills so that payments cannot be made after a certain time? In what scenario(s)?
How is autopay currently handled?
How will you communicate block payments to Invoice Cloud (CC or ACH)?
File Transfer
Internal Notes
Response/Decision
Date
Is there an automated process to produce the file? 
Files should be sent to IC any time there is a new billing
Which method will be used SFTP or Webservice?
SOAP Web services can only be used when coding to Invoice Cloud BIF specification.

Adjustments
 
Internal Notes
 
Response/Decision
Date
What is the best way for IC to update balances? An API is preferred to allow IC to connect to your system to obtain the most recent balance.  
 
Invoice Cloud prefers using an API to connect to the external system to obtain real time balances.  This is referred to as RTDR (real time data refresh)?
 
API: 
(RTDR - Real-time Data Refresh) Does the API allow balance to be pulled by invoice or by full account balance?
API:
  Will the API reflect the balance including any late fees, etc.?
Files Needed
If an API cannot be provided, the following files are needed to keep balances updated.
IC Adjustment File (BAF)
Review specs
Integrator file (if not using IC BAF)
Can you customize what is produced in the file?  Can invoice number be added if not present?
Requirement:  If a bill is paid outside of Invoice Cloud and the balance is now zero, the adjustment file must include this information.
Will the file contain the adjusted balance or only the adjustments amount for each invoice?
Balance differential verses fixed adjustment
How often can Adjustments be sent?
 
Adjustment File must be sent a minimum of 1x per day

 Invoice Cloud Datapump
 
What type of email changes are expected?  
Registered customer email address, unregistered customer email address, one time payment email address (payer).
If no, What format should we send these items to you? (Prompt for sample file)
 
 
From CIS
 
 
Invoice Cloud updates blocking of ACH/CC (cash only) customers in real time. Can this status be included in your API balance response (RTDR)?
 
 
If no, IC Customer Update File (CUF) is preferred.
 Review IC CUF Spec
If no, Billers must manually update blocked payments via biller portal

Payments from Invoice Cloud
Internal Notes
 
Response/Decision
Date
Would you be able to receive an API call to your system when payments are made in Invoice Cloud (Datapump)?
Can the API also be used to send ACH Rejects/Voids/Chargebacks/Credits
Are there specific GL codes that must be used?
Are additional fields available in the API to submit a reference number?
Reference number would be used to pass a Payment GUID.  The payment GUID must be validated in the event a duplicate payment is sent in error.  If a payment GUID is on file already, the second payment would be blocked (error).
Is a ReceiptGUID required?
Payment GUIDs are generated for each payment made for each invoice.  A ReceiptGUID can contain multiple payments for different invoices and are representative of a transaction.
If no, would you be able to receive a file to your system when payments are made?
 
What file format should we send this information to you? (request for sample file)
