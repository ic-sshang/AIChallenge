Background
Currently if a payment is declined, the user is notified on the payment confirmation screen. To change their payment information, they must go through the whole payment route again. This creates friction for the user that may have a negative effect on adoption.
We are improving the declined payment user experience in

 and want to measure the potential ROI of this initiative. 
Research Goals
Estimate the potential impact on adoption/revenue that will result from improving the user experience of declined payments in the checkout flow.

Disclaimers on Paths in Pendo
Paths timeout after 60 minutes, so if the user makes no activity after 60 minutes, the path would end and a new path would begin the next time the visitor interacts with the site
Sometimes the path shows “no next step” while other times the path just ends – both represent the end of the path. Pendo just explicitly shows there's no next step when there are multiple branches of a path.

Research Question: 
How many users re-attempt after their payment is declined? How many of those users end up successfully completing a payment? 
Note: The below paths filters out the steps taken after a declined payment to provide a quick view of how many users successfully process a payment after a declined payment.

Takeaways:
Once a payment is declined, on average 37% do not complete another attempt to pay (users may drop-off at multiple stages of the payment process). 
This means only 63% re-attempt a payment.
Of those that re-attempt, on average 75% result in a payment 
Projected Results
Key Assumptions
Our average Revenue Per Transaction (RPT) is $1.30 according to 
Tableau data
 (filtered from 1/1/24-12/31/24)
Using our average FY 2024 data, 37% of 742k drop-off per quarter. That comes out to ~281.2k transactions per quarter, or ~93.7k per month.
Conservative Case
If 1% more users re-attempted after a declined payment (meaning 64% re-attempt), that would result in capturing 
1.8k
 more transactions per month and we would gain 
2.3k MRR
.
Calculations
Current:
63% of 760k re-attempt per quarter = 478.8k, or 159.6k per month
75% re-attempts result in payment
75% of 159.6k is 
119.7k
 per month
Future:
64% of 760k re-attempt per quarter = 486.4k, or 162k per month 
75% re-attempts result in payment
75% of 162k = 
121.5k
 per month which is 
+1.8k 
from current
Best Case
The re-attempt of the same payment method is typically very high (>80%)
If 80% users re-attempted after a declined payment, that would result in capturing 
32.3k
 more transactions per month and we would gain 
42k MRR
.
Calculations
Current:
63% of 760k re-attempt per quarter = 478.8k, or 159.6k per month
75% re-attempts result in payment
75% of 159.6k is 
119.7k
 per month
Future:
80% of 760k re-attempt per quarter = 608k, or 202.7k per month 
75% re-attempts result in payment
75% of 202.7k = 
152k
 per month which is 
+32.3k 
from current

Observations:
Looking at the average results from 2024
Payment declines not resulting from any action prior are likely a result from failed payments through autopay or a recurring scheduled payment – these workflows are not in scope for this initiative
