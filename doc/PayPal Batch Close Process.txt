PayPal Batch close process runs very similar to the other batch close process and runs once every hour. The job name on skybot is ICGatewayAutoClose and will attempt to close PayPal Brands and Braintree (CC/ACH) payments. 
If a Biller is on a custom close schedule the custom close process will close the batch at the requested scheduled time. 
What happens if the batch fails to close? 
An error email is sent to 
IT_Processes@invoicecloud.com
 , Client Services, Anita Peterson, Shaun Deery, and Rushlan Khan.
CS/Ops team will attempt to close the batch again in the CRM. 
Batch closes successfully then no further action. CS/Ops will respond via email that the batch has been closed. 
Batch fails to close in the CRM then CS/Ops must reach out to a member in Team 6 so that they can attempt to close the batch and/or research the issue. 
3. Reach out to the 
Integrations
