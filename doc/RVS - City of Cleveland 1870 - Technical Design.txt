File Mapping
Invoice File
File Extension: CSV
File Delimiter: comma
Specification: None - see mapping below
Sample File: A1-G1 are specific to Cleveland, they are not file headers. A1 and I1-BF1 are true file headers
Note: The biller uploads a file with 46 columns.  When the invoice file runs through Biller File Split, a calculated field for the Biller Invoice Type is added to the end of each invoice record making the file have 47 columns.  When it is ready to process with SWS, the additional column tells SWS what IC Invoice Type to assign the invoice too.
File Frequency: Once a month (Stratus task will run once per day)
City of Cleveland is using ‘fixed’ City, State and Zip fields because the fields in file may contain other data (ex. notes). Due to the address fields in the file containing data other than address information, the data is fixed by RVS in different columns that IC has mapped.
