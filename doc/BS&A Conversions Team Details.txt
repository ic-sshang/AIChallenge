Summary
The BS&A Conversion outlines key considerations for transitioning billers to the BS&A platform, serving as both a scope and setup guide to ensure smooth onboarding and implementation. Since BS&A supports only one InvoiceCloud BID per biller, any separate tax and utility BIDs must be merged, and BS&A to BS&A Cloud upgrades require minimal involvement from Invoice Cloud beyond post-upgrade monitoring.
Duplicate bill handling must be configured by enabling specific settings in the biller's system.
File extraction guidance is provided via links for utility and tax data, and invoice types must be consistently identified using predefined IDs.
For billers using remote PDF linking, InvoiceFormatID 1131 must be used, and no sample images are needed.
Testing credentials and URLs are included for staging and production environments, though BS&A typically does not test for a conversion or upgrade.
 Process
Definitions
·        BID: Biller ID used in InvoiceCloud to identify separate billing systems (e.g., tax, utility).
·        EBPP: Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment.
·        PDF Linking: A method for presenting bills using remote file references instead of uploading images.
·        InvoiceFormatID 1131: Required format ID for PDF-linked invoices in BS&A.
·        CRM: Customer Relationship Management system used to manage invoice settings.
Key Responsibilities
·        
BS&A & Biller:
 Configure the system to flag and display duplicate bills.
·        
Project Manager (PM) & Biller:
 Confirm whether the biller has multiple InvoiceCloud BIDs and ensure they are merged if necessary, guides file extraction, sets up testing access
·        
Biller
 (guided by PM): Select invoice types to be processed and ensure correct Invoice Type IDs are used.
·        
PM
: Use provided sample files or guide the biller through the file extraction process.
·        
PM & Development Team
: Set up PDF linking and confirm correct InvoiceFormatID is applied.
·        
PM: 
Provide testing credentials and ensure access to staging and production environments.
Quality Assurance
Biller or BS&A
: Validates successful file transmission to the test portal.
Project Manager
: Tests connectivity of the endpoint URL in the CRM.
Project Manager
: Verifies that all web services and advanced settings are updated with the correct endpoints after testing.
Project Manager
: Monitors post-upgrade performance during BS&A to BS&A Cloud upgrades.
Roles
Biller
: The client organization undergoing the conversion. Responsible for providing data, credentials, and access needed for integration and testing.
BS&A (Provider)
: The platform provider and data source. Responsible for transmitting billing data to InvoiceCloud, configuring system capabilities (e.g., duplicate bill setup), and ensuring endpoint compatibility
Project Manager/PM (InvoiceCloud)
: The primary coordinator for the conversion project. Manages technical setup, communication, and validation tasks between InvoiceCloud and the biller.
Procedure
Confirm BID Structure
Verify if the biller has multiple InvoiceCloud BIDs (e.g., for tax and utility).
If so, they must be merged, as BS&A supports only one BID per biller.
Duplicate Bill Setup
BS&A configures the system to flag duplicate bills.
Biller enables this in:
Program Setup > Program Settings > Billing Settings > Bill/Notice/Email Messages > Tab #3
Check “print this message” and include the word “duplicate” on line 1.
File Extraction
Use sample files provided after kickoff, or refer to BS&A’s extraction guides:
Utility:

Tax: 
https://invoicecloud.app.box.com/file/908935419748
 
Invoice Type Selection & ID Assignment
Determine which invoice types will be processed.
Use consistent Invoice Type IDs for setup:
Misc. Receivables: 0
Special Assessments: 6
Summer Tax: 7
Winter Tax: 8
Utility: 42
Permits: 43
Business License: 57
Misc. Payments/General Receipts: 68
Village Tax/Delinquent Tax: 95
PDF Linking Setup (if applicable)
Enable remote linking for bill presentment.
Ensure invoices use 
InvoiceFormatID 1131
; update in CRM if needed.
Note in coding doc: “using BS&A reporting/remote linking.”
No sample images required.
Testing Access
Use provided credentials and URLs for testing:
§  Login URL -

Username: invoicecloud
Password: Invoicecloud123!!!
§  Test Payments:

Cloud Upgrade Monitoring (if applicable)
BS&A to BS&A Cloud upgrades require minimal IC involvement.
A maintenance window and data pump hold are required.
Project Manager monitors any post-upgrade issues.
