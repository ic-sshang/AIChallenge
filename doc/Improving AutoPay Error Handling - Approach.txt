 Problem:
When AutoPay fails for a customer due to an internal or external job error, (1) customers do not receive an email notifying them that their payment did not process, and (2) billers are unaware because no reporting or notifications exist today.

What’s happening today
The initial AutoPay job that runs overnight can have failures that occur for a variety of reasons.
Today, we do not send emails to Payers due to internal errors (outages, intermittent failures) or external errors (chase outage, processor unreliability)
The support person on-call will 
manually re-run 
AutoPays that failed after the first once completes. This results in:
Resolved. Successful re-run of AutoPay.
Failed re-run.
Billers: A message will appear in the Biller Portal (“There is an unknown problem processing AutoPay”) to let them know but no details surrounding the error or which payers are impacted is provided.
Payers: The do not know this did not successfully run. All they know is they are on AutoPay, and usually, no news is good news.
IC: We will not manually re-run these again. Any invoices left with a balance will not get re-picked up on AutoPay until their next AutoPay collection date.
As a result:
Payers have unpaid invoices that they assume were taken care of because they are on AutoPay and were not notified.
Billers now have to deal with late invoice processes & disputes from Payers
 Future state
Billers
 will have a new 
report
 in the Biller Portal with details regarding AutoPay failures so they can reach out to them if desired.

 Biller Report
Billers will have a new report in the Biller Portal with details regarding AutoPay failures. Billers can use this report to:
Waive penalty for these customers
Reach out to customer to let them know
Manually process payment using stored payment method on behalf of customer
Note: 
This is VIP for insurance because they can use the report to not cancel coverage on the customers impacted by the AutoPay failures since it is not the customer’s fault.
