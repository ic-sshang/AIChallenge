Highlights
Call brief
Invoice Cloud team members, along with Chris and Marci from Truckee Meadows Water Authority, discussed a prototype chatbot designed to assist customers with bill payments. The key highlights include Truckee Meadows' interest in exploring the chatbot's capabilities beyond just payment functionality, the importance of integrating the chatbot with existing payment options, and the agreement to continue the collaboration and potentially test the solution in the future.
Key points
Invoice Cloud is developing a chatbot to assist customers with tasks like making payments, enrolling in autopay, and paperless billing.
Truckee Meadows Water Authority receives around 6,700 support calls per month, with higher volumes in the summer.
The chatbot prototype demonstrated allows customers to search for their account, make a payment, and enroll in autopay.

Truckee Meadows prefers a direct "Pay Bill" option over initiating the chatbot, as they believe most customers will use that first.
The chatbot could potentially handle other utility-related inquiries beyond just payments, but the initial scope is focused on payment functionality.
Truckee Meadows is open to testing the chatbot prototype, but would like to see an integration with their planned Amazon Connect call center solution.
Invoice Cloud will provide the link to the prototype for Truckee Meadows to review and provide additional feedback.
Both parties see value in continuing the discussion and exploring opportunities for collaboration.
The chatbot prototype demonstrates progress, but there are still open questions around user experience and integration that need to be addressed.
Next steps include further discussions on scope, functionality, and integration as Invoice Cloud continues development.
