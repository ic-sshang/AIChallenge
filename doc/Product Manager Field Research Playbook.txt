Before the Visit: Preparation Guide
Personal Preparation (Mindset & Goals)
Internalize the mission:
 You’re not going to validate your backlog—you’re going to 
learn what jobs people are really trying to get done
. The goal is empathy, not efficiency.
Rehearse questioning style:
 Practice open-ended probes with a colleague. Example:
Colleague: “I like the dashboard.”
PM: “Tell me about the last time you used it. What were you trying to accomplish?”
Plan to be uncomfortable:
 Silence, awkward answers, or side-tracking are normal. Curiosity thrives in those gaps.
Research & Homework
Company & Context
Industry basics:
 Know whether you’re walking into a tax office, a utility billing department, or an insurance shop. Each has different regulatory and customer service pressures.
Company profile:
 Look up annual reports (if public), press releases, and local news. Be aware of mergers, regulatory battles, or customer controversies.
Participant Profiles
LinkedIn research:
Identify job history (What other systems might they have used?)
Tenure (Veterans may be workaround wizards; new hires may see inefficiencies more clearly.)
Skills and certifications (CPA vs. IT admin vs. call-center rep).
Persona matrix prep:
 Mark where each participant fits—Frontline / Mid-management / Executive. The aim is balance across this spectrum.
Hypothesis Building
Write 
3–5 hypotheses
 about what you expect to see. Example:
“Clerks still use offline spreadsheets to reconcile.”
“Managers care more about reporting than transaction entry.”
“Government offices are constrained by legacy software integrations.”
Hypotheses aren’t truth—they prime your brain to notice either confirmation or disconfirmation.
Logistics & Travel Planning
Clustering visits:
 Group by geography. If you’re visiting a county tax office, look for nearby utilities in the same trip.
Time buffers:
 Always pad visits with extra time. Fieldwork takes longer than conference calls.
Physical environment prep:
 Government offices may require ID badges; insurance companies may restrict devices. Confirm in advance.
Tools & Materials Prep
Check your kit:
Test recorder and lav mic. Record 30 seconds, play it back.
Fully charge phone and battery pack.
Pack hardcopy consent forms and observation sheets (don’t assume printers on site).
File naming convention:
 Decide how recordings will be labeled (e.g., 
Vertical_CustomerName_Date_ParticipantRole.mp3
). Nothing kills synthesis like “Audio1_finalFINAL.mp3.”
Pre-Visit Alignment
Team briefing call:
 If multiple PMs are going, align on who’s covering what roles. Example:
PM1 leads questioning.
PM2 observes silently, sketches workflows, timestamps key quotes.
Internal expectations:
 Write down:
What you 
must
 learn (e.g., refund process steps).
What would be “nice to learn” (e.g., how they train new hires).
Pre-Trip Ritual (Night Before)
Re-read participant bios.
Review your hypotheses.
Rehearse your intro and consent script out loud.
Get a full night’s sleep. A tired PM is a sloppy observer.
Quick “Pre-Trip Checklist”
Reviewed company background & vertical context
Mapped participant personas on LinkedIn
Drafted 3–5 working hypotheses
Confirmed travel, timing, and on-site access rules
Tested equipment (recorder, phone, charger, mic)
Printed consent forms & observation templates
Agreed roles if traveling with another PM
Rehearsed intro and question style
Packed kit

During the Visit: Field Research Playbook
Arrival & Setup
Tone-setting
Smile, shake hands, make eye contact. Your goal is to 
blend in, not interrogate.
Script:
“Thanks for letting me sit with you today. I’m not here to sell you anything or judge how you work. I just want to understand how billing fits into your day, so we can make the portal easier for you.”
Recording consent
Always ask explicitly before hitting record.
Script:
“Would you be comfortable if I record audio? It helps me stay present instead of writing furiously. The recording is for internal research only.”
Hand over consent form (if required).
Logistics check
Set recorder or phone mic in a nonintrusive spot.
Test audio before diving in.
If shadowing multiple people, clarify: “I’ll mostly be watching quietly and asking questions here and there.”
Observation First (10–15 minutes)
Golden Rule:
 
Don’t jump in immediately.
 Let them show their natural flow.
What to watch for:
Physical artifacts (sticky notes, binders, second monitors).
Body language (frowning, sighing, quick repeated keystrokes).
Interruptions (phone calls, co-workers asking questions).
System hopping (how many different tools do they juggle?).
Note-taking shorthand:
⚡ = frustration
⭐ = delight
🔄 = workaround
✋ = interruption
🕒 = time sink
Example note:
⚡ “Has to retype customer ID into 3 different screens.”
Guided Conversation (30–45 minutes)
Question strategy
Start broad, then funnel into specifics.
Avoid “yes/no” questions. Use “Tell me about…” and “Walk me through…”
Always follow up with 
“Why?”
 or 
“What makes that important?”
Core Jobs-to-Be-Done Prompts
Walk me through your day. Where does billing fit?
What’s the hardest part of this job?
When something goes wrong, what usually causes it?
How do you know you’ve done a good job?
What do you do if the system isn’t working?
What tools do you use outside this portal?
If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing, what would it be?
Probing for depth
If they mention a task:
Them: “It takes forever to post payments.”
You: “Tell me about the last time you posted payments. What slowed you down?”
If they give a feature request:
Them: “We need one-click refunds.”
You: “Can you describe the last refund you processed? How did it go?”
Shadowing & Workflow Mapping (Optional, if time allows)
Draw the workflow on paper while watching. Arrows, boxes, sticky notes—don’t worry about polish.
Capture “handoffs” (e.g., clerk → manager → IT). These are hotspots for friction.
Note tools used in sequence.
Capture Artifacts
With permission, photograph:
Desk setup.
Whiteboards or sticky notes.
Custom Excel sheets.
If video allowed: capture screen navigation (short clips, not the whole session).
Mark timestamps when notable quotes happen for easier review later.
Wrapping Up (10 minutes)
Closing questions
“If this portal disappeared tomorrow, how would you cope?”
“What’s the most stressful part of billing for you personally?”
“If you could design the perfect tool, what would it do?”
Script to end session
“This was incredibly valuable. Everything you shared will feed into how we redesign the portal. Thank you for being so open—you’ve given us a window into what really matters.”
Offer a small token if appropriate (company swag, gift card, handwritten thank-you). It reinforces goodwill.
PM Behavior Rules of Thumb
Shut up & watch:
 Don’t jump in to fix their process, even if it looks painful.
Don’t defend the product:
 If they complain, absorb it. “Tell me more about that.”
Silence is your friend:
 Wait 3–5 seconds before following up—people often reveal gold when filling silence.
Stay neutral:
 Don’t signal approval/disapproval with your face or tone.
Immediate Field Notes (while memory is fresh)
Jot top 3 insights before you leave the building.
Capture 
direct quotes verbatim
 (these are more persuasive than summaries).
Flag “surprises”—anything you didn’t expect.
After the Visit: Post-Visit Steps for Each PM
Write a Field Memo Within 24 Hours
Use the 
Field Memo Template
 (same structure for everyone → consistent synthesis).
Include:
Biller name, vertical, size, location.
Participants + roles.
Top 3 jobs-to-be-done observed.
Pain points (⚡), delights (⭐), workarounds (🔄).
Direct verbatim quotes (at least 3–5).
Any unexpected surprises.
Your “Magic Wand” ideas (what users wished for).
Rule:
 No more than 2 pages per visit → forces prioritization.
Organize Raw Assets
Save audio/video/photos with a clear naming convention (
Vertical_Biller_Date_ParticipantRole
).
Upload to a shared drive (structured folder per visit).
Drop raw notes into a 
central note-taking system
 (e.g., Notion, Confluence, or Google Drive).
Reflection Exercise (15 minutes solo)
Write down:
“The moment that surprised me most was…”
“The moment that frustrated me on behalf of the user was…”
“The opportunity that seems biggest is…”
These gut-check reflections catch things you might otherwise discard.
Pre-Synthesis Prep
Extract your 
Top 5 Quotes
 and 
Top 5 Observations
 into a one-page “Highlights Sheet.”
These highlight sheets make synthesis faster—nobody wants to scroll 50 pages of raw notes during a workshop.
Team Synthesis Workshop
Step 1: Pre-Work (AI Acceleration)
Use AI tools (like ChatGPT with transcripts or notes uploaded):
Clustering:
 Ask it to group all raw observations into themes (e.g., reconciliation, refunds, delinquency, training).
Quote tagging:
 Have it extract quotes by sentiment (frustration, delight, workaround).
Cross-vertical comparison:
 Prompt it to identify unique vs. common themes across industries.
Tip:
 Always review AI output with a human lens—it’s a compass, not gospel.
Step 2: Workshop Setup
Gather the whole PM team in a room (physical or virtual).
On the wall (or Miro board), create columns:
Jobs to Be Done
Pain Points (⚡)
Delights (⭐)
Workarounds (🔄)
Magic Wand Ideas
Step 3: Theming Exercise
Each PM posts sticky notes (or digital equivalents) of their highlights.
Cluster similar notes together.
Label clusters with plain language:
“Payment posting & reconciliation”
“Refunds too slow”
“Delinquency communication gaps”
“Portal navigation confuses new hires”
Step 4: Prioritization
Use a 2×2 matrix: 
Impact on user vs. Frequency observed
.
High impact + frequent = top opportunities.
Rare but high impact = niche innovation bets.
Frequent but low impact = low-hanging usability fixes.
Step 5: Persona Layering
For each theme, mark which personas felt it most:
Clerks vs. Managers vs. IT vs. Executives.
This helps avoid designing everything for one persona while neglecting others.
Step 6: Opportunity Statements
Rewrite themes as 
problem/opportunity statements
:
“Clerks spend 30–60 minutes daily double-entering payments into Excel because they don’t trust the system totals. How might we increase trust in automated reconciliation?”
This turns raw frustration into actionable design challenges.
Step 7: Cohesive Readout
Structure final readout as:
Executive Summary:
 5–7 key opportunity areas.
Persona Profiles:
 Summarized JTBD per role.
Thematic Deep Dives:
 Pain points, quotes, artifacts.
Opportunity Statements:
 Ranked by impact × frequency.
Use AI to polish language, create visuals (word clouds of common quotes, charts of pain-point frequency), and condense.
Step 8: Storytelling for Execs
Open readout with 
a user quote that punches in the gut.
Layer in photos (desk setups, sticky notes).
End with “Here’s how our portal redesign could eliminate these pains.”
AI-Boosted Deliverables
Theme Reports:
 AI can digest transcripts and cluster into themes much faster than manual.
Persona Summaries:
 Feed in LinkedIn bios + field notes → AI drafts persona narratives.
Sentiment Heatmaps:
 AI can highlight which verticals/roles had the strongest negative or positive signals.
Quote Libraries:
 AI can tag, categorize, and pull the strongest quotes into a searchable database.
