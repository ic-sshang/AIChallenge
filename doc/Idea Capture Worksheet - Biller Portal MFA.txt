Question
Answer
What problem or opportunity is the customer experiencing? Why is this problem meaningful and worth addressing?
Billers face increased security threats like phishing and unauthorized access, compromising the management of customer accounts. Addressing this issue is crucial to protect sensitive data, maintain trust, and comply with security standards.  Specifically, the PCI DSS 4.0 requirement 8.4.2 requires the use of MFA for any users with access to the 
Cardholder Data Environment
.  Our inability to provide this will affect our compliance, effective Mar 31 2025.
What value proposition does this product / feature provide for the end user? How will it address the core problem or opportunity?
MFA provides an extra layer of security, reducing unauthorized access to biller portals. This protects sensitive customer data, enhances trust, and demonstrates a commitment to security and regulatory compliance.
Who is the end user of this product / feature?
The end users are billers using the portal to manage customer accounts, including insurance companies, local governments, utility companies, and other businesses.  They are within scope due to their access to sensitive customer and card data.
What will this product / feature do better than other available alternatives?
This MFA feature will offer a seamless, user-friendly experience with SMS and potentially other authentication methods, ensuring wide accessibility for all billers.
How will we make money on this product / feature?
MFA enhances biller satisfaction and retention, attracts new security-conscious billers, justifies premium pricing or security-focused service tiers, and reduces fraud-related costs, improving overall financial performance.  Specifically, a per-use fee or subscription fee are possible options.
What happens if we don’t build this product / feature (now)?
Without MFA, we will fail to achieve PCI compliance, and also impact our ability to move up market and satisfy increasingly common RFP requirements.  Additionally, the portal remains vulnerable to breaches, risking financial loss, damaged trust, customer churn, negative publicity, competitive disadvantage, and regulatory penalties, especially for sensitive sectors like insurance and large enterprises.
