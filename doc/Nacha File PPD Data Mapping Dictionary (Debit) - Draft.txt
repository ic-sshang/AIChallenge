1. Optional Fields
Fields marked as 
optional
 in the NACHA specification are not strictly required for file acceptance by the JPM. However, their inclusion may be necessary depending on:
Business rules
Client-specific requirements
Receiving bank expectations
Interpretation
: Optional fields should be treated as configurable. The file generation logic and business context should determine whether they are included.
2. Database-Sourced Fields
Fields marked as 
database-driven
 are typically dynamic and vary per transaction or batch. These include:
Receiver account and routing details
Transaction amounts
Effective dates
Transaction codes
Interpretation
: These fields are strong candidates for sourcing from the 
Funding Instruction schema
. This isn’t final, and anything that says “Database” is what makes sense for now on what should be stored in the Funding Schema. 
3. Hardcoded Fields
Fields marked as 
hardcoded
 are static values defined by the NACHA format (e.g., record type codes, format codes). Some may contain sensitive or environment-specific values such as:
Immediate Origin
Company Identification
Routing numbers
Interpretation
: These values can be stored in a 
Key Vault
 for security or a 
configuration file
 for flexibility. The decision should be based on the value and whether it makes sense to store in vault or just have it hardcoded in code. 
4. Configurable Fields
Fields marked as 
configurable
 are semi-static and may vary by client, environment, or use case. Examples include:
Company Name
Entry Description
Origin Name
Interpretation
: While these are often stored in config files, they may be better managed as part of the 
Funding Instruction schema
 if they vary per line item / funding instruction
