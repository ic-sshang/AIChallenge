The reason for this is to ensure the current 2.0 Azure Batch (possibly other) pipelines run successfully. Since they do not have all the necessary SDKs installed, even if they are included as a package in the test project, the pipeline may fail to build and run the tests in NUnit projects if it was added as a Core/.Net 6+ project.
If you’ve already added the NUnit .Net Core+ test project to the solution with 4.6.1 (or similar .Net framework) project(s), then you will have to delete it in VS and delete the folder on the local drive where the repo was cloned. Then you can begin the steps below. Be sure to bring over any tests, references, etc. if you have to delete and recreate the test project.
Open the solution in VS 2017 (VS 2022 may not have the options to create class libraries targeting lower frameworks)
Create a Tests folder in the solution (may need to switch to Folder View in the Solution Explorer)
Right-click on the Tests folder → Add New Project
Select Class Library (.NET Framework) and a name, e.g., FunctionalTests or IntegrationTests with the framework set to match the main project
Add reference to the main project
Add latest NUnit for the target framework
Choose the NUnit3TestAdapter based on this chart, e.g., use 4.3.1 NUnit for .NET 4.6.1 
https://docs.nunit.org/articles/vs-test-adapter/Supported-Frameworks.html
Add Microsoft.CodeCoverage (no dependencies)
Add Moq (if needed) – 4.17.2 for .NET 4.6.1
