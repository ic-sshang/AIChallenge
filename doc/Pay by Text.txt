Quick Fixes
If a Payer has opted out of receiving text messages (sms) to their phone by texting “stop” back to the notification, they will not receive sms notifications to the phone number in question. This includes other accounts. To revert this they can reply “RESUME”, and they should receive a text message back.
Customization
Invoice Type Setting 26 is used to make changes to the text message sent to the payer.
