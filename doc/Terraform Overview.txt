Terraform is our Infrastructure as Code (IaC) platform that enables us to define, provision, and manage infrastructure resources in a consistent and repeatable manner.
It can be accessed via the
 cloud environment
 with proper authentication credentials.
Key Features
Infrastructure as Code:
Define infrastructure using declarative configuration files
Version control your infrastructure alongside application code
Create reusable modules for infrastructure patterns
Multi-Cloud Support:
Deploy resources across various cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP)
Maintain consistent workflows regardless of target environment
Support for 3,000+ infrastructure providers
State Management:
Track resource relationships and dependencies
Detect drift between desired and actual configurations
Manage complex infrastructure changes safely
Automation Capabilities:
Plan and preview infrastructure changes before applying
Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments
Support for programmatic approvals and policy enforcement
Benefits
Consistency:
 Deploy identical environments across development, staging, and production
Efficiency:
 Reduce manual provisioning efforts and human error
Scalability:
 Easily scale infrastructure up or down based on demand
Collaboration:
 Enable teams to work together on infrastructure through version control
Use Cases
Cloud Provisioning:
 Deploy and manage resources across public and private clouds
Network Infrastructure:
 Configure firewalls, load balancers, and network topology
Policy Compliance:
 Enforce security and compliance standards across all deployments
Service Orchestration:
 Coordinate complex multi-tier application deployments
Infrastructure as Code vs Manual Provisioning
Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Definition:
 IaC involves managing infrastructure through code rather than through manual processes, treating infrastructure configuration as software that can be edited, versioned, and executed.
Focus:
 IaC emphasizes repeatability, version control, and automation, enabling teams to deploy consistent environments quickly.
Use Case:
 IaC is essential for modern DevOps practices, allowing infrastructure to be managed alongside application code and deployed through automated pipelines.
Manual Provisioning
Definition:
 Manual provisioning involves using console UIs or CLI commands to create and configure infrastructure resources individually.
Focus:
 Manual provisioning relies on human operation and often leads to configuration drift and undocumented changes.
Use Case:
 Manual provisioning might be used for one-off tasks or initial exploration but is generally discouraged for production environments.
Key Differences
Speed:
 IaC enables rapid deployment of complex environments that would take hours or days to configure manually.
Risk Management:
 IaC allows changes to be reviewed, tested, and approved before implementation, reducing risk.
In summary, Infrastructure as Code provides significant benefits for managing complex environments at scale. Terraform is our primary IaC tool, enabling us to maintain consistency, efficiency, and reliability across our infrastructure.
