Rules of Engagement
Clients need to work with Oasis on determining what services they are going to be utilizing and what server or applications they will be getting from Oasis.  In the past Jiffy Thomas has been a contact inside Oasis that has worked with InvoiceCloud in providing integration components like passwords and usernames as well as endpoint URLs.  
In Oasis the client needs to determine what environment they will point to InvoiceCloud test.
