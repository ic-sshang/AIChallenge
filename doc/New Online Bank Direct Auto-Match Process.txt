Introduction
The 
New Online Bank Direct Auto-Match Process
 process is designed to automate the matching of RPPS entries for online banking direct transactions. This process streamlines the task of matching payments with billers efficiently, using Azure Batch's parallel processing capabilities.

Process Flow
MC_RPPS Inserts RPPS Entries
The process begins with the 
MC_RPPS
 component, which inserts RPPS entries into the IC system.
Logging Job in DB IC_PERF_LOGGING
Once the RPPS entries are successfully inserted, 
MC_RPPS
 calls the 
DB IC_PERF_LOGGING
 to insert a daily job record. This job serves as a record for the 
ICOBDAutoMatchController 
to start.
ICOBDAutoMatchController Starts
Before 
ICOBDAutoMatchController 
starts, it will check to see if there’s a daily job record in 
DB IC_PERF_LOGGING
. If the record is not in the DB, it will sleep for 5 minutes and try again 5 times. If the record is in the DB then it will start the controller process.
Creating Azure Batch Job
A new job is created in Azure Batch using the obtained 
jobName
 and pool ID.
Creating Azure Batch Tasks per BillerID
Tasks for the job are created based on the 
jobID
, 
jobName
, and biller data by calling the 
CreateTasks
 method from the 
tasks
 object.
Running the ICOBDAutomatchProcess Pool
The 
ICOBDAutomatchProcess
 pool runs in the Azure Batch environment. It is designed to process a specified number of billers simultaneously, allowing for efficient parallel processing.
Monitor Job
To monitor the 
ICOBDAutomatchProcess
, we will post updates in the 
#dailyjobinfo
 (#mclogin_dailyjobinfo when testing) slack channel. 
If for any reason any tasks/controller fails. 
We would trigger an OpsGenie alert 
that will call whoever is on call for the BMS team. We would also tag whoever is on call in the 
#dailyjobinfo
 channel. 
Updating IC_PERF_LOGGING
After all billers have been processed, the system updates the 
IC_PERF_LOGGING
 database to mark the job as complete by adding an end date. This signifies the successful completion of the job.
Benefits
Efficiency
: The new OBD auto-match process leads to faster RPPS entry matching by using Azure Batch’s parallel processing capabilities.
Scalability
: The Azure Batch environment allows for parallel processing, making it scalable to handle large volumes of Billers.
Logging and Monitoring
: The use of 
Azure Batch, New Relic, Slack, and OpsGenie 
provides detailed job tracking and monitoring capabilities.
