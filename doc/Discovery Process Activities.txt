Discovery Cycle Models (Based on Size & Complexity)
Each cycle is 
standalone
 and corresponds to the 
scope of the opportunity
:
Cycle
When to Use
Complexity
Team Effort
Outcomes
1–2 Weeks
Small fixes, known problems, low risk
Low
Light cross-functional alignment
Validated hypothesis, Power Score update
3–4 Weeks
Medium opportunities, moderate unknowns
Medium
Focused sprint with validation loops
Lean Canvas, solution sketch, feasibility check
5–6 Weeks
High uncertainty, cross-team impact, net-new ideas
High
Full discovery initiative with structured planning
Full business case, solution design, delivery prep
🧩
