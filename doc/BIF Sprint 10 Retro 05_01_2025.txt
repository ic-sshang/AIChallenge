Everyone’s experience is valid
Focus on improvement, not placing blame 
Start doing

Random Thoughts/Music Request
Grooming non-standard/roadmap work first (backlog review, barbershop, etc)
Confirm decisions required to start planning new work (ie CRM pages)
Start thinking like Marcus/coding standards when reviewing items to try to limit bounce-back in final review
Setting up meetings for reviewing with Marcus before the end of sprint for larger code changes
Making research spikes to prepare for large/new changes
Continue to schedule meetings with Marcus if it looks like the item needs more thorough review.
Maybe the reviewers should also be the one to bring it up to the assignee?
Continue to bring up alerts for discussion in case of duplicate research/work items 
Question to raise: what should be done to prevent items from being carried over?
Should we be looking at breaking up the item more to digestible pieces if it gets carried over?
Would pair-programming help resolve these carry over items?
Question relating to above: Is there a way to approach research items differently so they don’t carry from sprint to sprint?
Maybe scheduling a meeting with the team related to review it, after bringing it up in stand-up?
