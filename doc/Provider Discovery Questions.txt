What administration config/features do you provide?
What is your pricing model?
Can you provide technical guidance on what an integration would look like?

Engineering/Implementation
How well does your platform integrate with .NET applications (e.g., .NET Core/ .Net Framework)? Do you provide SDKs or middleware for seamless integration?
Can we define and enforce granular MFA policies based on user roles, device, location, or risk score?
To what extent can we customize the hosted login and MFA user experience to match our branding and UX standards?
What built-in threat detection or adaptive access capabilities (e.g., geo-risk, behavioral analytics) do you provide, and how are they configured?
Do you support SCIM or API-based user provisioning and deprovisioning across multiple identity sources like Azure AD or LDAP?
