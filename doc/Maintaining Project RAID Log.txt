RAID Overview
A RAAIDD log is a project management tool used to systematically track and manage

ecisions throughout the lifecycle of a project. The RAID log is maintained in SmartSheet and 
is one of the most important project management artifact to maintain
.  
While not the same in importance, an analogy I think is helpful to understand the concept is the following.  The RAID log is to the project manager what air traffic controller data is to a airplane pilot. A PM without an updated RAID log is simply hoping everything will go well, but they really don't know just as a pilot can only hope to make it to their destination safely and on time without air traffic data.  Conversely, a PM who has an updated RAID log has the confidence that they are proactively ensuring their project will be delivered on time and a pilot flying with air traffic control data has confidence that they have the necessary information to fly safely and on-time.
Why a RAID log is so important:
Centralized Information:
 The RAID log serves as a centralized repository for key project information related to risks, actions, issues, and dependencies. This ensures that all relevant stakeholders have access to the latest updates.
Proactive Management:
 Regularly updating and reviewing the RAID log allows the project team to proactively address potential risks, issues, and dependencies, minimizing their impact on the project. It promotes a proactive and forward-thinking approach to project management.
Communication and Collaboration:
 The RAID log facilitates transparent communication and collaboration among team members and stakeholders. It provides a shared understanding of the project's challenges and the necessary actions to overcome them.
Decision Support:
 Having a comprehensive view of risks, actions, issues, and dependencies assists project managers and stakeholders in making informed decisions. It helps in adjusting project plans, allocating resources, and mitigating potential disruptions.
Documentation and Audit Trail:
 The RAID log serves as a documented history of the project, aiding in post-project analysis, audits, and knowledge transfer. It provides a valuable resource for future projects and organizational learning.
In summary, a RAID log is a fundamental tool for effective project management, offering a structured and systematic approach to identify, track, and manage key elements that can impact the success of a project, including Risks, Actions, Assumptions, Issues, Dependencies and Decisions.
Risks
Definition:
 Events or situations that 
could
 impact the successful completion of a project.  
Importance:
 Identifying and documenting risks is crucial for proactive risk management. This allows the project team to anticipate potential challenges and develop strategies to mitigate or respond to them.  A risk can turn into an issue as more information is learned or if it’s not remediated.  
A risk becomes an issue when it switches from “could” impact the project to “will” impact the project.
Examples
A biller has another separate internal project or initiative, database upgrade for example, that could impact their Go-Live.
A key resource on the project leaves the company.  This should be tracked as a risk until a replacement is in place and up to speed.
3rd party schedule (CIS)
Actions
Definition:
 Specific tasks or activities that need to be undertaken to achieve project objectives.
Importance:
 Documenting actions is essential to ensure that necessary steps are taken to move the project forward. Regularly updating the RAID log with actions helps track progress and ensures accountability.  When documenting actions, its 
critical to clearly state what the action is, who is responsible for completing it, and by when.
Examples
Biller needs to return signed Go-Live sign off sheet by 7/6/24.
Javi needs to submit a Jira ticket to Integrations for a requirement that was discussed on the project status call by 7/1/2024.
Assumptions
Less Common.  In a RAID log, assumptions are expectations of what is or will be in place during a project that contribute to its success. They are factors that the project team is already certain about, often due to experience or expertise. Assumptions allow a team to proceed without full information or evidence at a given time. For example, a project manager might assume a certain level of project progression or that a hardware device will arrive safely and on time.
Issues - (Most Important)
Definition:
 Problems or roadblocks that have occurred that 
will
 impact a project and need resolution.
Importance:
 Effective issue management is critical for keeping the project on track and addressing challenges promptly. The RAID log documents issues as they arise, detailing their nature, impact, and proposed or implemented solutions.  
Each issue should have an assigned owner who is responsible for remediating the issue, a priority level, and a target due date.
 
Updates should be recorded against each issue at least weekly in the comments section of the issue in SmartSheet.
 
It is very important to assign a priority level to each issue using the below criteria as this will feed into determining the project's Red, Amber, Green (RAG) status.
Issue Priority Levels:
High
 - Considered a blocker to Go Live if not remediated.  Needs immediate attention and plan to remediate.
Medium
 - Not currently a blocker to Go Live, but significant issue that needs to be remediated quickly before it becomes a blocker.
Low
 - Not impacting Go Live, but an issue that needs to be tracked/resolved; ideally before Go Live, but not necessarily all.
Examples
The biller’s new CIS implementation is delayed by 4 weeks and it will push out IC’s Go-Live.  This type of issue should be classified as a 
High
 priority because it is a blocker to Go-Live.
The Integrations coding ticket is delayed by 2 weeks due to an issue found in SIT.  It is not currently a Go-Live blocker.  This type of issue should be classified as a 
Medium
 priority as its not currently blocking Go-Live.  It should be monitored closely and if new information reveals that it will indeed block Go-Live is status should be updated to 
High
.
Biller or CIS will not commit to Go-Live date.  This should be logged as a 
high
 priority issue as its a blocking issue.
Int mod where biller Tulare would like service address added, but can be done after GL.  This would be a 
Low
 impact issue.
Dependencies
Definition:
 Relationships between different tasks or activities in a project.
Importance:
 Understanding and managing dependencies is crucial for ensuring that tasks are completed in the right sequence and that the project stays on schedule. The RAID log identifies dependencies between tasks or external factors, helping the project team anticipate potential delays and adjust plans accordingly.
Examples
The project has product enhancement requests that need to be delivered during the implementation.  In this case the item would start as a Dependency.  Its duration and due date were determined during the Work Breakdown Structure planning process during the schedule creation.  If its delivered on time it will only be tracked as a dependency, however, if it is late and 
threatening Go-Live
 then it can be transitioned to an issue because it 
will 
then impact Go-Live.
A biller is going live with a new CIS at the same time as InvoiceCloud.  The CIS implementation should be tracked as a Dependency.  If all goes well, and the CIS Implementation is on schedule, it can be closed as a Dependency.  However, if the CIS Implementation becomes delayed, and threatens our Go-Live date, it should be transitioned to an issue.
Decisions
Definition:
 Relationships between different tasks or activities in a project.
Importance:
 Recording all project decisions in a central RAID (Risks, Assumptions, Issues, Decisions) log ensures that critical information is systematically documented, providing a single source of truth. This enhances transparency, accountability, and communication among stakeholders, facilitating better project management and decision-making.
Examples
The biller decided they no longer want to use IVR, or a specific payment method.
Using RAID Logs in SmartSheet
The RAID log automatically gets provisioned with your SmartSheet project.
