In Azure Key Vault, 
RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
 and 
Access Policies (ACLs)
 are two distinct models for controlling access to secrets, keys, and certificates. Here's a breakdown of the differences and when to use each:
🔐 
Access Policies (ACLs)
Legacy model
 for Key Vault access control.
You explicitly define 
who
 (user, app, or service principal) can access 
what
 (keys, secrets, certificates) and 
how
 (get, list, set, delete, etc.).
Managed 
within the Key Vault itself
.
Limited to 
up to 1024 access policy entries
 per vault.
Granular control
 over specific operations (e.g., allow 
get
 but not 
list
).
Use when:
You need fine-grained control over specific operations.
You're working with older Key Vaults or existing infrastructure using access policies.
🛡️ 
RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
Modern model
 integrated with 
Azure-wide RBAC
.
Permissions are granted via 
Azure roles
 (e.g., Key Vault Reader, Key Vault Secrets User).
Managed 
outside the Key Vault
, at the 
subscription/resource group/resource level
.
Supports 
custom roles
 and 
role inheritance
.
Easier to manage at scale, especially in large organizations.
Use when:
You want centralized access management across Azure resources.
You're using Azure AD groups or want to leverage role inheritance.
You need to manage access at scale or automate via infrastructure-as-code.

Best Practice
For 
new deployments
, Microsoft recommends using 
RBAC
 for Key Vault access control. It aligns better with modern Azure governance and scales more effectively.
