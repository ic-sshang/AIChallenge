Goals
Review payment adoption metrics and growth over time.
Discuss payment channels and options offered, as well as new options to consider.
Review upcoming enhancements to the biller portal.
Discuss pain points and complaints they’re experiencing, and how to solve them.
Summary
 
POSITIVE FEEDBACK
 regarding our responsive customer service and additional payment channels and options.
 MOSTLY HAPPY WITH SERVICE 
FOR NOW…
 We are in the green with them, 
but it could drop to yellow if we don’t quickly address their 2 main issues.
 
SERIOUS ISSUES TRACKING PAYMENTS
 from start to finish. If we don't help clean that up, they could get dinged during an audit.
 
DELAYS POSTING PAYMENTS
 are annoying customers and bogging down their customer service team. We need to sort that out ASAP.
😕 
COMPLEX PAYMENT PROCESSOR RELATIONSHIPS
 led to confusion during implementation. The relationship with these payment processors seems messy. 
We need to map it out for clarity and to avoid finger pointing for future issues.

Notes
Payment Adoption Metrics
Reviewed adoption metrics from Q2 2022 to Q2 2023
Total invoices paid increased 11% year-over-year
Total payment value processed increased 10% year-over-year
Current adoption rate is 42%
Payment Channels and Options
Currently accept credit cards, ACH, lockbox checks, online bank payments, cash
Discussed adding CheckFree Pay to capture cash-paying customers
Considered outbound marketing campaigns and donation options
Online Bank Direct
A question was asked if the system could be improved to "forget" about a bad match, so that it doesn't try to auto-match the same payment to the wrong account in the future based on previous incorrect learning.
Reconciliation Issues
Some credit card and ACH payments are taking 2-3 hours to post, but in some cases it has been days. This is a big problem for their CSR team. 
Customers will call to check on a payment they made hours ago, but it's not visible yet so the CSRs are unable to provide a definitive answer about payment status.
This wastes time that could be spent helping other customers. It also frustrates customers who are kept waiting or unsure if their payment went through. The root causes need to be diagnosed so we can work on improving posting speeds.
For payments that take days to post, customers may think their payment didn't go through or get confused about when it will be applied to their account. CSRs have to stop what they're doing multiple times a day to research and confirm payment statuses when customers call.
The payment tracking/reconciliation issue is a major concern. Currently they cannot provide a full audit trail when requested to show the path of a payment from start to finish in their systems.
When the auditor asks to see the paperwork for a specific payment, they have to piece it together from multiple sources but there is a "gap" they cannot account for between our system and theirs. 
This will likely cause them to fail their audit this year.
Currently the level of payment data provided, like just noting a payment was made via credit card, is not granular enough for their reconciliation needs. They want data like the last 4 digits of the card or more identifying details.
Providing a more detailed data feed with additional payment attributes could help address this issue. Enhancing the integration to pass along richer payment information would allow them to fully track payments between systems for auditing purposes.
The goal is to close the gap in tracking from InvoiceCloud to their internal billing platform.
Relationship with Payment Processors
Involves multiple third parties like Paymentech and various card brands.
Lack of clear mapping of responsibilities caused confusion on issues.
Took months working with multiple parties to resolve some cases.
Upcoming Portal Enhancements
New file dashboard to view invoice upload status in real-time.  
Improving email and audit log histories with 24-month retention.
Embedding help articles directly into relevant portal pages.
Creating roles to customize permissions instead of per-user.
