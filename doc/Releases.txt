Release Preperation Process
Ensure you know which 
Change Window
 the Change is classified as, which must be set in the related 
PLAT
 Item but is not yet a required field on 
INFRA
 Items.
If the Change Window is not 
Anytime
, then determine which day the Release will be applied to 
xat
 and 
prd
 and then see if a 
Confluence Article 
and 
Jira Release
 already exist, if not, create new ones, if ones already exist add you Change to these.
If the Change Window is 
Monthly
 then see the 
Monthly Maintenance Schedule
 for available days (note only one per Month).
Publish the Release Day and Plan to the 
engineering-maintenance
 Slack Channel.
Setup an Outlook Meeting with the Key Participants from the Platform Team and the Key Application Stakeholders who will be impacted by the Change.
