 It performs all necessary steps to deploy the application and enforces progression through a predefined set of environments, with approvals along the way. All web applications will use the template for deployment, which means that they will all be required to move through the proper approval and environment promotion process. With deployment pipelines, we can actually enforce this at the environment level so that only applications deployed using this template are allowed to be deployed to the production environment.
Deployment Flow
This is the overall process that a web application artifact follows to reach production.
