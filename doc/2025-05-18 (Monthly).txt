 AppGateway_Infrastructure
 
We ran into an issue with the App Gateway apply during 2025-05-12 Release, an error trying to access a KeyVault Secret during the Azure API’s validation of the App Gateway change requEST, so this blocked the execution of any changes to the App Gateway (which none were expected anyways, would have been a no change after successful validation).  We updated the 
azurerm
 Version and the Terraform Version and want to see if that fixes the issue we observed.

Notes from this Maintenance
this page in Opsgenie 
https://invoicecloud.app.opsgenie.com/settings/integrations/?page=2
 has moved to JSM. Will need to track down how to turn off Proxy Alerts through JSM.
When running updates through AUM, leave the maintenance window time at the default value of 235 minutes. The cumulative updates need time, setting it less than this might result in a failed update and will have to re-run the updates.
