Need for Change?
When the Salesforce ticket is closed this automatically cancels the JIRA tracking in DS Project. This automation is good to take an incident off the board and has its own caveat on the inability to track the effort already put in by the DS team.
Dependency Mapping
The Salesforce Case number has a JT Record for mapping between Case Number and Jira Service Management DS incident number. This two-way sync between Jira and Salesforce is performed by workato automation.

Process Change and Automation
The below process changes and automation is an attempt to address the concern. When an incident is canceled from Salesforce. 
The following actions will be triggered.
Collect the details from Salesforce
Reason for cancellation – No field is available as of now, need to work with the JIRA team on the enhancement request with the right drop-down menu like Reason for Submission
JIRA Sub State for canceled must be captured and probably should be captured even if the transition state doesn’t have the sub-state (New, Pending, Work in Progress), especially when moved from pending to work in progress.
In the JIRA DS project. 
The following actions will be taken as described in the below flowchart.
Next Steps:
The workato automation needs to be enhanced to take care of the new condition.
