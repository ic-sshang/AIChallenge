Add on Team Process


The Delivery (Add on) Team needs to evaluate if the Add on product will require new Terminals (a/k/a MID(s), TD(s)).  This determination will be useful in projecting go live dates and the need for additional paperwork that Boarding sends out.  The following flow chart can help determine if a new Terminal will be required for the Add on.
