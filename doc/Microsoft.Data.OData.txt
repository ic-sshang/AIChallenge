About this library
Microsoft.Data.OData is a .NET library used for building OData (Open Data Protocol) clients and servers. This protocol allows for the creation and consumption of queryable and interoperable RESTful APIs in a simple and standard way. It's commonly used by developers working on .NET applications that need to consume or generate OData feeds. Microsoft.Data.OData is deprecated, for new projects or applications requiring OData v4, Microsoft recommends using the newer Microsoft.OData.Core library.

ICAutopayController
IC.Azure.Batch had a dependency on IC.Azure.Blob package which was a legacy version that had a dependency on Microsoft.Data.OData
Update IC.Azure.Blob on IC.Azure.Batch to the latest version.
OData was not used by the legacy version of IC.Azure.Blob which made the path to upgrade easier.
This was the 2nd library that had OData tied to it.  The other, so far, was WindowsAzure.Storage, which was tackled with the solution below.  
The latest version of IC.Azure.Blob came with a KeyVault requirement which led to us needing to update ICAutoPayController to have MI/KeyVault patterns.

Updating IC.Azure.Batch introduces managed identity so managed identity creation and 2.0 YAML roll out is necessary.
