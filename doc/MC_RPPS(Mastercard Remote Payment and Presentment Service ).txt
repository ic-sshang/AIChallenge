Restarting Job Based on a Failed Step  
There will be some instances when the job will be completed successfully but will fail on certain steps. We will receive slack message whether the files for Fiserv and MCRPPS were successfully created or not.     
When this happens, it is not necessary to run the entire job all over again but run the step that uploads the return file.   
For this example, we have the Fiserv return creation fail, so what must be done is to run the project for that specific step to upload the Fiserv return file in the MCRPPS project and select the CreateManualFiservFile branch.   
 
Manual Fiserv File Upload 
 
ManualFiservFileUpload
  
This is the link to the repo that you can clone in case you have to rerun this specific step for Fiserv. Same way can be done for the MCRPPS return file. All that needs to be done is uncomment the portions for MCRPPS and comment out Fiserv.   
Here is an example on what the error looks like when the return file failed.   
It is right before step 5 to complete the return file, before running the step, you will need to check if the return files are still available in their respective folders to upload the files before running that portion. You can run the job to debug, which is highly suggested and keep stepping through incase the error happens again, and we’ll check accordingly how to fix the issue if there is one.   
  
  
This is where you can find the return files
