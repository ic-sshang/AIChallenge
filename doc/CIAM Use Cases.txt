End User (payer, customer, delegate)
These are your bill-payers or their delegates logging in to view, pay, or manage accounts.
Authentication (happy path)
Log in with username/password and start a session.
Use corporate SSO (Okta, Azure AD, Ping) to access the portal directly.
Be redirected from the portal to an external IdP, sign in, then return with a valid session.
Stay logged in seamlessly when moving between portal apps/subdomains.
Stay logged in across mobile and web apps without re-entering credentials every time.
Authentication (exceptions)
Enter wrong password → see generic error, retry with lockout limits.
Account temporarily locked after too many failed attempts.
Get notified of suspicious login (new device, unusual location) and complete extra verification.
Deal with expired session by re-signing in.
Be required to reset password if it’s expired, compromised, or disallowed.
Be challenged for MFA when logging in from a new device or risky location (or always).
MFA flows
Enroll in MFA after first login (choose SMS, email, authenticator app, WebAuthn).
Enter OTP from SMS or email to continue login.
Use authenticator app (TOTP) to generate a code.
Approve push notification on mobile or confirm with number matching.
Use passkeys (biometric device login) for passwordless sign-in.
Use recovery codes if MFA factor unavailable. (unsure on this one, needs research)
Switch to a backup factor if the primary one fails (e.g., SMS didn’t arrive).
Account self-service
Register a new account (with email verification).
Complete profile setup (phone, name, consents).
Change email, phone, or password with re-authentication and verification.
Reset a forgotten password (via email link or SMS OTP).
Link accounts if multiple logins exist (e.g., personal + corporate).
See account login history
 and revoke active sessions/devices
.
Deactivate or delete own account under privacy rules (GDPR/CCPA). (unsure if this is needed, need to review these regulations)
Branding & UX
Experience branded login page (logos, styling, vanity domain).
Use mobile-friendly MFA prompts.
Receive branded, trustworthy-looking magic link or OTP emails.
Interact in localized language/format (dates, numbers).
Use accessible flows (screen reader, large tap targets, CAPTCHA alternatives).
Biller Admin (internal admins managing users/tenants)
These are portal administrators, not end users.
User management
Create new user accounts (manual 
or bulk
).
Assign, update, or remove user roles/permissions.
Update user attributes (name, email, phone).
Deactivate/reactivate or delete users.
Reset a user’s password or MFA factor.
Manage user membership across multiple tenants/brands.
Grant delegated or impersonation access (with consent and audit).
Security enforcement
Require MFA enrollment for all admin accounts.
Force password resets for users after security events. (need more on this before we can determine if it’s required)
Enforce step-up auth for high-risk actions (adding payment methods, viewing account numbers).
Define session timeouts, token lifetimes, and “remember device” policies.
Branding & configuration
Configure login branding per tenant (logos, colors, messages).
Set up vanity login domains and ensure proper TLS.
Manage consent forms and privacy policies shown to users.
Data cleanup
Identify duplicate users (same email/phone).
Merge or resolve conflicting records.
Enforce unique constraints for identity data.
Suppress invalid or bouncing emails.
Customer Support Agent (internal IC)
These are staff helping end users with login/account issues.
Support actions
Search for users by email, phone, or account ID.
See account status (locked, MFA enrolled, sessions active).
Assist users with password resets or MFA resets (with identity verification).
Send secure one-time links for assisted login.
View audit trails to explain login failures or suspicious activity.
Impersonate a user account (with consent) for troubleshooting.
Flag accounts for fraud monitoring or restriction.
Implementation team (TBD who owns this and how much remains manual)
These folks build, configure, and maintain the CIAM integration.
Authentication integration
Set up federation with Okta, Azure AD, Ping, or other IdPs (SAML/OIDC).
Map IdP attributes (email, roles, tenant).
Handle JIT provisioning (auto-create users on first login).
Manage de-provisioning (via SCIM or scheduled sync).
Configure multiple IdPs per tenant, with domain discovery.
Rotate IdP keys/certs with zero downtime.
API & event handling
Integrate SecureAuth APIs for auth, user management, token handling.
Use SCIM for provisioning/deprovisioning automation.
Consume SecureAuth webhooks for login, MFA, risk events. (is this needed?)
Enrich tokens with custom attributes for billing apps.
Ensure webhooks are idempotent and retried safely.
Risk and fraud integration
Apply risk scoring (IP reputation, geo, device signals).
Configure CAPTCHAs or challenges for suspected bots.
Route anomalies to SIEM/logging for monitoring.
Session & token management
Implement PKCE in mobile apps.
Configure refresh token rotation & detection of reuse.
Bind tokens to device/browser fingerprints.
Migration support
Import legacy users (hashed passwords or reset-on-first-login).
Run dual login paths during migration (legacy + SecureAuth).
Implement account linking for conflicting email records.
Build rollback plan to legacy auth if needed.
Security / Compliance Team
They care about risk management, auditing, and compliance.
Monitoring & auditing (we should validate this is/isn’t available via SecureAuth portal)
Get real-time dashboards of login success/failure.
Monitor MFA enrollment rates and risk-based challenges.
Track fraud events (credential stuffing, brute force).
Review full audit trails of user/admin activity.
Monitor token/session anomalies.
Compliance
Ensure WCAG accessibility compliance.
Implement GDPR/CCPA features (deletion, export).
Control log data retention & pseudonymization.
Map CIAM operations to SOC2/ISO27001 controls.
Enforce consent collection & versioning.
Operational resilience
Load test auth flows for billing cycles.
Validate multi-region failover.
Run pen-tests targeting auth flows.
Ensure key/cert rotation playbooks are followed.
End User Devices / Systems (non-human personas)
These are automated flows that must work seamlessly.
System interactions
Browser stores sessions securely (SameSite cookies).
Mobile app consumes PKCE/OAuth tokens.
APIs accept valid OIDC tokens from SecureAuth.
Legacy systems consume identity mappings until migration completes.
Automated fraud detection receives SecureAuth events via webhooks. (TBD how we’re being notified of fraud)
