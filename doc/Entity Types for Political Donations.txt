At a Glance 
WDIL-13 introduced new platform functionality to support the selection and storage of payer entity types—
Personal
, 
Corporation
, or 
LLC
—during PAC donation flows. These changes were necessary to meet compliance and reporting requirements for political contributions, as requested by The Doctors Company (BID: 4389) whose operations depend on accurate entity classification. The platform previously lacked support for this feature, prompting collaboration with SPAM. 
Problem
During the onboarding of a new biller to the platform, a requirement emerged for capturing payer entity types—individual, corporation, or LLC—specifically for political donations made to DOCPAC. This functionality was not previously supported by the platform, which meant there was no mechanism to prompt payers to identify their entity type during the payment process. The absence of this capability posed a challenge for the new biller, who relies on accurate entity classification to meet regulatory and reporting obligations. To address this gap, we introduced new functionality that leverages CRM configuration to trigger a UI prompt, ensuring entity type selection is captured at the point of payment. This work was initiated to support the onboarding of the new biller and to expand the platform’s compliance capabilities for political contributions.
Solution
To support the onboarding of a new biller requiring entity type classification for political donations, we introduced platform-wide enhancements enabling payers to select their 
entity type
—
Personal
, 
Corporation
, or 
LLC
—during the payment flow. This new functionality ensures compliance with political contribution regulations and improves data accuracy for downstream reporting. The donation entity type selected is stored in the Donations Detail tab
