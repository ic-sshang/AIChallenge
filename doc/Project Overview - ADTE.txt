Overview
Enhance the business categorized critical applications with configuration best practices, health checks, and a MVP for regression suite test coverage. 
Goals
Reduce incidents related to deployments
Improve software quality
Increase test automation coverage
Improve software documentation
Reduce scope of k8s migration work

Primary: Tarun, Ankita, Jose, and Martin

Tooling
Enhance the Open AI code analysis tool:
Pull/clone target code repo based on main / master from ADO
Provide software documentation that identifies the components to be covered in a health check
Provide software documentation that identifies components that can not be configured per environment  
Generate health check code, covering identified components, to be integrated into the target software
Generate automated tests of the health check to be integrated into the regression test suite for the target software and deployment environment (test suite should be added, if not already, in the target code repo as a separate project)
Critical Software Asset Inventory

Candidate Software Assets
The assets below have been qualified from the asset inventory based on distinct run and deployment models.   Each asset will be used to prove out the AI tooling enhancements.  A software analysis (control base) of each asset will be conducted and used to verify the output of the AI tooling and a iterative approach of tooling modifications used to achieve the desired output.

Notes
Add Health Check Endpoint
Configuration checks
Verify application configuration is valid and that all required settings are present (environment variables, config file settings, etc…)
Database connectivity
Verify the connection to database(s).  Ensure application can communicate with the database server(s).
External service availability
Check the availability of external services that the application depends on (Azure Key Vaults, Azure Blob Storage, FTP, etc…)
Logging
Ensure application can write to the log. 
Version
Ensure application is running the correct version, output version information.
Response
200 status code (healthy)
503 status code (unhealthy)
Software analysis is done by assigned architect and health check design artifacts created and published.
Implementation of health check in the code is done by assigned SRE.
Automating of health check test is done by assigned SDET/SRE and included in the regression test catalog. 
Regression Tests
Critical functionality test(s)
Create automated test(s) to ensure essential functionality of the application in the target deployment environment (Dev, UAT, Regression, Production, etc…)
Critical tests identified by assigned SME and runbooks created and published outlining how to test.
Automating of test runbook is done by SDET / SRE and included in the test catalog.

Notes
Add Health Check Command
Command logic must always be executed on startup
A command line switch must be added to isolate executing just the health check
Configuration checks
Verify application configuration is valid and that all required settings are present (environment variables, config file settings, etc…)
Database connectivity
Verify the connection to database(s).  Ensure application can communicate with the database server(s).
External service availability
Check the availability of external services that the application depends on (Azure Key Vaults, Azure Blob Storage, FTP, etc…)
Logging
Ensure application can write to the log. 
Version
Ensure application is running the correct version, output version information.
Response
Return zero for application exit code (healthy)
Return non-zero for application exit code (unhealthy)
