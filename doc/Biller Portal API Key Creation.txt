Summary
Within the biller portal there is a feature that allows a biller and or software partner to create an Application API Key. Billers or Software Partners that code to our REST APIs will need to create an Application Key.  This key serves as the authentication token they will use to connect to the REST API. It is recommended that every application that uses the REST API uses a different Application API Key. This will allow developers to be able to easily turn off access to individual applications to the Invoice Cloud systems.
