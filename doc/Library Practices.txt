When to Share a .NET Library
Code Reusability
: If the library contains common functionality that is used across multiple projects, sharing it can reduce code duplication and maintenance efforts.
Consistency
: Sharing ensures that all projects use the same version of the library, maintaining consistency in functionality and behavior.
Centralized Updates
: Updates and bug fixes can be made in one place and propagated to all dependent projects, simplifying maintenance.
When to Separate .NET Libraries
Independent Release Cycles
: If projects need to be released independently, separate libraries allows each project to evolve at its own pace without being tied to a shared dependency.
Customization
: When different projects require customized versions of the library, separating allows for tailored modifications without affecting other projects.
Isolation
: If the projects are significantly different in scope or domain, keeping libraries independent can prevent unintended side effects from shared dependencies.
Simplified Dependency Management
: Separate libraries can simplify dependency management, especially in complex projects where shared libraries might introduce conflicts.
Considerations
Versioning
: If you choose to share a library use the Nuget package manager to manage versions and dependencies effectively.
Refactoring
: Refactoring shared libraries can impact multiple projects, so thorough testing is required.  Library unit tests are essential.  Use the unit tests as the contract, any changes to the inputs and outputs would likely impact consumers.
Team Coordination
: Shared libraries require good communication and coordination among teams to manage changes and updates.
