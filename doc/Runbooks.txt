Here you will find documentation on handling common alerts.
Golden Alerts
Golden alerts represent the most important metrics of a systems health and are broken down into four categories.
Saturation: 
How full the system is
Latency: 
How long the system takes to process a request
Throughput: 
The rate of requests it is processing
Errors: 
Error rate
The exact details of each 
golden metric 
may vary depending on the context at which you are observing the overall system.  For example, an API team may measure 
Throughput 
as requests per minute. However, the platform team who is observing the cluster as a whole may measure using network packets/bytes in/out instead.
