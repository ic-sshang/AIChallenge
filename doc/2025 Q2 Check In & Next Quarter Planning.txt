 Next Quarter: Items Under Consideration
List out what the team proposes to do for next quarter, highlighting whether the item must be done next quarter (with a date if applicable), should be done, or could be done.

 Open Questions
Provide a list of any discussion questions the team has, especially if there are decisions/actions needed to unblock the next quarter’s roadmap. 
When we committed to the Proxy Service K8s migration for Q2 we were planning on doing all of the work but when we discussed this with the Proxy Service owners they requested to do the work related to the Proxy Service application changes so this has put that initiative at risk for completion in Q2.  Should we reconsider the working agreement?

 Notes
The list of epics mentioned for Q3 is under consideration and will be groomed and prioritized by the end of Q2.
