Payer/MyIIS Project
:
The UI and business logic are tightly coupled, resulting in a large portion of the code being untestable or uncovered. Over 80% of the business logic is tied to the UI, meaning that UI testing is currently the only way to validate functionality. Separating the business logic into a library like ICCommon would make the code more testable, reduce the reliance on UI automation in the QA framework, and allow developers to write more unit tests and deliver faster. This change aligns with the transition towards a nextgen architecture.
This could be a 6-month project requiring a backlog to be created.
RSP
: Timeboxed spike to assess solutions. Currently focusing on SP optimization and may revisit for code refactor.

Mailgun Suppressions:
 When a customer enrolls with an email address, we send it to Mailgun for validation. If the email is invalid, Mailgun flags it as bounced and includes it in a batch file of bounced emails that we receive. While we store this information in a table, we currently don't use it to validate emails before sending. Our bounced email report is based on this data.
If we try to send an email to the same address again, Mailgun identifies it as previously bounced and doesn't attempt to send it, so we don't receive another bounce notification. Each email attempt counts towards our quota, and this year, we incurred overage costs for exceeding our sending limit. This could be a feature development opportunity for cost savings, and we can explore it further with the India team. (This is technically not a “tech roadmap” item)
Product Suggestions
Email or SMS Tech Debt Reduction
 
RD to provide further input: There is a concern regarding this refactoring work. As the Architecture team is considering this as part of their 2025 strategy for email handling. Engineering and architecture should be aligned to avoid wasted effort, ensuring that engineering doesn’t refactor now only for architecture to redesign later.
Payer Portal Reverse SSO (To improve connection out to Biller’s 3rd party portals)
Today, payers need two separate logins to access their utility invoice and view meter usage data for the same account. Enhance the SSO product to enable authentication from an InvoiceCloud-authenticated session to an externally authenticated session.
Payment method validation: 
We currently lack a reliable method for payers to verify that a saved payment method belongs to them. This issue commonly arises with multi-user accounts for new billers, where the first payer to access the account is given access to the saved payment method details.
Email Templates updates
: Many large insurance billers are requesting custom email templates due to limited customization options, misaligned fields, and missing key insurance details. This results in time-consuming template creation, delaying go-lives, and causing some carriers to turn off our emails, impacting a key value driver.
Email with different domains (mailgun) {To be updated} Timeline: Q2 2025 (TM)
Raw notes:
Allow the team to focus on specific apps or modules within the application even for tech related updates. This helps them to gain expertise faster and ability to contribute to product roadmap easily.
Dependency on TL/US teams for PR reviews and also QA → need to be factored in.
