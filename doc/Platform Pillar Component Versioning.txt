Assumptions
The InvoiceCloud Application Platform is comprised 7 Main Pillars as outlined below:
Infrastructure
Terraform IaC Templates and Modules
Terraform Apply and Destroy Pipelines Templates
Virtual Machine Configuration
Ansible or Packer Templates and Modules
Configuration Apply Pipelines 
Application Build Pipelines
Azure DevOps .yaml Pipeline Templates
Application Deployment Pipelines with Post Deploy Tests
Azure DevOps .yaml Pipeline Templates
Container Build Pipelines
Azure DevOps .yaml Pipeline Templates for Container Image Publishing to ACR
Helm Charts
Helm Charts for specific types of Applications
Azure DevOps .yaml Pipeline Templates for Chart Publishing to ACR
Observability
NewRelic Golden Metric Terraform Modules
Requirements
Must be able to easily understand which Versions of each Component are intended to work together without additional changes. 
Versioning Strategy
platform-{PLATFROM-VERSION}/{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}
Expands on 
semantic versioning
, adding a platform version prefix to the normal semantic version of the component. Could easily implement this with 
GitVersion
.
Given a version number 
platform-{PLATFROM-VERSION}/{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}
, increment the:
PLATFROM-VERSION
: when you release a new version of the platform as a whole, i.e. a breaking change across Platform Pillars.
MAJOR
: when you make incompatible API changes, i.e. a breaking change within a Platform Pillar.
MINOR
: when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner.
PATCH
: when you make backward compatible bug fix or minor change to existing functionality.
