Random Thoughts/Music Request
Triage data conversions at the ITG level +1
Do some courses in mindtickle 
Meeting for items in Final review? +1
At least so that we review as a collective team before tech-lead (Marcus) has to, or a dedicated time with the tech-lead for their review
Possible Spike breakdown? (what makes a spike, mainly for documentation if anything)
Triage platform conversions into INT?
Tyler is worried about platform conversion items being forgotten in ITG queue
No more DB calls in constructors :heyman:
Large story-point research items should be broken up smaller +1
Frequent grooming sessions (barber shop 
 ) +2
Completing deliverables before research items
Rotating host of barbershop sessions
Documenting applications/processes
Share audio when streaming screen during retros
Should we utilize raise hand Zoom functionality?
