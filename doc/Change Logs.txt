Changes made to values in tables are stored in the following tables:
ChangeLogs
ChangeLogsByInvoiceType
Most of the “update” stored procedures (
upd
) already support recording changes to these tables.  Below is a screenshot of part of the 
dbo.updBillers
 stored procedure displaying some of the code that writes to the 
ChangeLogs
 table
The user type that triggered the change is also recorded in this table.  Changes are made by “Change Requestors” that are listed in 
tblChangeRequestor
(see below).  
The 
ChangeRequestorID
is recorded along with the change made in the appropriate change logs table.
The user that made the change is also stored in this table in the 
UserFKID
 column.
UserFKID
 was introduced in the last couple years.  Usage of it is not fully implemented to date.  In other words you will notice many of the values as 
0
 but you will notice others with values >
0
.  
Details about the user that made the change are stored in different tables, with 
ChangeRequestorID
 being a pointer for where to look.
For example, 
ChangeRequestorID=3
 users are stored in table 
Employees
.  
ChangeRequestorID=1
users are in table 
Billers
.  
In some cases the Change Requestor is a process and there won’t be a list of users.  For example, 
ChangeRequestorID=4
(Cloud Process) and 
ChangeRequestorID=6
(RTDR) indicate that these background processes triggered the change.  It is normal to have 
UserFKID=0
 for changes with these Change Requestors.
