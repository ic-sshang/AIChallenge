3/12 Block Payment Field Updates:
NoPaymentCode can be ignored.
StopFlag will unblock payments when receiving a contrary value against the current block status.
There is no change on isIvrPaymentAllowed. 
Invoice Cloud does not support blocking payments for individual invoices. Instead, the system allows setting PaymentExpirationDate and PaymentExpirationMessage to mark an invoice as expired. The invoice remains visible under the customer’s account; however, payments cannot be processed once it surpasses the expiration date.
The PaymentExpirationMessage will display the following, tailored to county-specific requirements: “Bill is not allowed to be paid online. Please contact the county office for more information”.
3/6 API Updates(refactor):
An upcoming update will introduce a flag indicating whether online payments should be blocked. This change will be implemented with the Farragut B9.7.0 release.
The RTDR will be used to identify if a bill has a flag that blocks a payment. 
Ex. when blocking a payment, set the expiration date the day before, and set it to 1/1/3000 to unblock payment.
The ‘Paid By’ field will be added as part of the B9.6.0 release in March. This addition will enable IC to send the payer's name through the data pump.
Summary: The set of endpoints that Invoice Cloud can use to integrate with the NCPTS billing and Collections system to collect bill data and subsequently submit IVR payments. 
Note: IVR is for web service, it’s not acronym of Interactive Voice Response. 
Authentication is handled by the county. 
Note: You will need to contact the county you are integrating with to receive the base URL to be used to call the APIs

https://rutherford.ncptscloudtest.com/ncptsexternal/api/payment/billsearch?abstractNumber=0000000012&yearFrom=2023&yearTo=2023
BillSearch: The BillSearch API is a GET method that returns the bills and bill details for the provided abstract number and tax year range.
The BillSearch API is needed to gather billing information related to the abstract number and tax year(s) the payment is for. The bill’s primary key returned in the BillSearch API call (accountPk) is required to submit a payment for the correct bill. 
abstractNumber(string): AbstractNumber (BillerInvoiceNumber) used to find bill data. Value should be left padded with zeros up to 10 characters.
yearFrom(BillerBillYear - integer): Lower bound (inclusive) on the tax year to include
yearTo(BillerBillYear - integer): Upper bound (inclusive) on the tax year to include

Block Payment: 
LegalActions - isIvrPaymentAllowed
 is specific to Legal Action cases and is configured by county based on case type. If this is blank, it would indicate the bill is not in a case. True/False should be self explanatory.
“StopFlag”
 is specific to RMV (Registered Motor Vehicle) bill type. This would indicate that there is a flag on the bill that is preventing an IVR payment for one reason or another. If StopFlag is 'Y', do not pay the bill.
isIvrPaymentAllowed
If isIVRPaymentAllowed = false
then block payments
If isIVRPaymentAllowed = true or empty/null
then don’t block payments. IC will unblock payments when receive contrary value against current block status. 
For Boolean type value: Y = true, Not Y = false (include null or empty)
Invoice Cloud does not support blocking payments for individual invoices. Instead, the system allows setting PaymentExpirationDate and PaymentExpirationMessage to mark an invoice as expired. The invoice remains visible under the customer’s account; however, payments cannot be processed once it surpasses the expiration date.

Example Block by NCPTS (Wage Garnishment Legal Action Type to NOT accept IVR Payments). If account payment is blocked, we will see similar error message, no payment will be allowed. 

{
    "Message": "Legal action type of WAGE GARNISHMENT does not allow IVR payments"
}
Response - payment blocked
{
  "Message": "Bill contains a flag that prevents IVR Payments. Account Number: string"
}
Error, Validation Error on at least one bill or no payment was provided.  If there are validation errors, then all validations for all bills, along with their account id, will be returned. Any changes to the database will be rolled back
There is a logic in the system that if a payment is being attempted by Invoice Cloud and the NCPTS system configuration is set up to not allow the payment, you will get a response indicating a block status.

Invoice Mapping from Previous Version
3/6 File Updates(refactor): 
Farragut will design and send the Biller Invoice File (BIF) and Customer Conveyance File (CCF). The BIF will include billing information along with ownership changes, while the CCF will focus solely on ownership changes.
The CCF must be loaded prior to the new BIF for ownership transfer. It is advisable to deactivate the previous BIF to stagger it after the conveyance file.
Name and address changes will be added to the new BIF file with a RecordType of U (Update).
The AmountDue will include any applicable fees or interest. IC will not calculate or combine any delinquent fees, interest, or penalties.
Certain flags, such as the HasOwnerTransferFlag, can be added for informational purposes, but IC will not use them for updates.
All file processes will utilize the current mapping to generate the AccountNumber for each Abstract Type.
A new BillType, Preliminary Bills(PRA, PRE, PRV), will be added. Farragut will perform a 'True Up' when the new bills are received, voiding the preliminary bill and merging any payments made onto the new bill.
Invoice File
InvoiceTypeID: 8 - Real Estate Taxes: 
Taxes (Real or personal)
InvoiceTypeID: 33 - Motor Vehicle: 
GAP Tax Bills
Summary: We will get one invoice file which indicates InvoiceType and Ownership Transfer status. These are documented separately below: 
Updates at 06/13/2024
Use PARCEL_ID as AccountNumber (REI - Real Estate Only)
Store BILL_PK to Custom11 for Data Pump - Payment
If Custom6(BILL_FLAG) does not include flag “GAPBILL”, we add invoice record to InvoiceTypeID 8 - Real Estate Taxes
If Custom6(BILL_FLAG) does include flag “OWTRA”(Ownership Transfer), we will verify with current CustomerName(Primary_Owner). If they are different, we start conveying process. 
Updates at 06/25/2024
Only REI - Real Estate has PARCEL_ID, and can be used as AccountNumber. The rest ABSTRACT_TYPE (FileSpecID 39 - Custom2) don’t have PARCEL_ID.
Use the following format as AccountNumber for BUS, IND and PUB types. BillNumber will not overlap across all types.
BUS - Business: PP-BillNumber(FileSpecID 347-BillerInvoiceNumber)
IND - Individual: PP-BillNumber(FileSpecID 347-BillerInvoiceNumber)
