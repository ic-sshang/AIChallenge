Current Quarter Commits
List out current quarter commitments that are 
 At Risk or 
 Delayed. Link to Jira items. Provide an update for each item: Why is it delayed, is there a way to pull it back to green, or do we need to reset the date. If we are resetting the date, provide the new date the team believes it can hit.

 Dev done, but still rolling out
Rollout started Aug 1, but several bugs have come up that have required us to rollback. Current bug is NEX-265. Fix will go live 9/11 and we will resume rollout where we left off. Should be fully rolled out by end of Sep, if no further issues.

 Testing has been a challenge resulting in delays. We are unable to test in a lower environment so we must test in Preview. This means slower cycles to apply code updates when addressing bugs, performance issues, etc.
 Planning to ship mid-September with a slow rollout starting
