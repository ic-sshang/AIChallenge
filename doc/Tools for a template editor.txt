The best technologies to achieve this would be to use a JavaScript combination of technologies based on the overall goal.
Frontend:
GrapeJS
Pros:
Versatility - it is highly customizable and supports drag-and-drop editing
Ease of Integration - It can easily integrate into our application, and it outputs simple JSON that can be easily exported and stored
Built-in Features - It contains a style catalog, template manager, assets manager, and more
Cons:
Learning Curve - May have a steeper learning curve as we have to learn its API and customization options
Performance - can be heavy and may impact performance if not optimized.
Craft.js
Pros:
React-based - It is built on React, making it easy to design your editor using familiar React components
Modular - it modularizes the building blocks of a page editor, allowing for extensive customization without modifying the library
Flexibility - You can control how components are edited and rendered, providing a good user experience
Cons:
Documentation - Is not well documented as compared to other frameworks
React-Page
Pros:
React-based - It is built on React, making it easy to design your editor using familiar React components
Customizable - Provides a high level of customization for building page editor
Cons:
Limited Features - It does not have as many built-in features as GrapeJS
Integration - Will require more effort to integrate with other tools and libraries if needed
Summary
If we prefer a highly customizable and modular approach and are comfortable with React, Craft.js might be the best fit.
If we need a versatile, feature-rich framework with built-in tools, GrapeJS could be more suitable.
If we want a React-based framework with a balance of customization and ease of use, React-Page is worth considering.
Backend: 
Express.js
Pros:
Minimal Design - We can structure the application as we see fit.
Lightweight - Good for high-performance
Cons:
Minimal Design - Because it is so customizable, we would need to create more tooling for common functionality compared to other frameworks. This also means that leaning and adding features can take longer and will require more effort on our part.
Sail.js
Pros:
MVC Based - Since it follows the Model-View-Controller pattern it provides a clear structure for the application
Built-in Features - Comes with built-in support for WebSockets, RESTful APIs, and real-time features that can be useful for our application
Cons:
Complex - More complex and opinionated than Express.js
Performance Overhead - Slightly more overhead due to its built-in features and abstractions
Summary
If we prefer a lightweight, flexible framework with a large community and extensive middleware options, Express.js might be the best fit.
If we need a more structured framework with built-in real-time capabilities, Sail.js could be more suitable.
Other technologies to consider
Blazor
Pros:
C# Instead of JavaScript - Blazor allows you to use C# for both client-side and server-side code, which can be beneficial since we are already familiar with the .NET ecosystem
Integration with .NET - Blazor seamlessly integrates with existing .NET libraries and backend systems
SignalR Integration - Blazor supports real-time web functionalities through SignalR, which is great for applications requiring real-time updates
Cons:
Performance - While Blazor is efficient, JavaScript frameworks like React might offer better performance for highly dynamic and interactive UIs
Ecosystem - JavaScript has a vast ecosystem with numerous libraries and tools, which might be more mature and diverse compared to Blazor
Crystal Reports
Although can be used, there is learning curve to fully understand the APIs and functionalities for Crystal Reports. We would also have to find a way to integrate this into a .NET framework, like Blazor, since this is simply a Library to be used in the backend.
