“Hello,
This is [Employee Name] from InvoiceCloud.
Can you please redirect me to someone who can assist me with installing a piece of software called Stratus for [Biller DBA]?
Stratus is the tool we use to deliver files from your location to InvoiceCloud securely.
We recommend installing Stratus on a station that is accessible to more than one person in case you ever need to run a task manually or troubleshoot file transfer issues with us.
The station you choose also needs to have administrator rights and .NET 4.6 framework installed with continued internet access to 
http://www.invoicecloud.com/
 on ports 80 and 443.
Please let me know a good contact to work with so I can get this software installed.
If you are the right contact, can you please respond with available times you have today or within the week to schedule an appointment for this installation?
