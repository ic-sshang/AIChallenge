SSO Options - enable/disable customer portal change/update options according to a single-sign on integration
Invoice Type Option 40
Block Customers from paying on Invoices with Balance Forward payments
This option should be enabled for all Daffron/Milsoft billers because this integration only support balance forward. Payments should not be made on any invoice other than the most recent.
Invoice Type Option 41
Only allow payments on:	Most Recent Invoice First
This dropdown should always be set to ‘Most Recent Invoice First’ so that payments cannot be made on previous invoices. Integration is a Balance Forward model.
53
Customer Portal - Pre-select Open Invoices
By default, IC preselects all Open Invoices in the Customer Portal when going to make a payment. Unchecking this option will result in the invoices not being pre-selected.
Disable - Daffron has main and sub accounts and does not want open invoices pre-selected 
(If the biller wants this functionality, you can enable it. By default, disable)
54
Biller Portal - Allow cart functionality within Search Invoices
By default, the IC Biller Portal only allows payments of single invoices. This option can be turned on to be able to pay more than 1 invoice at a time within the Biller Portal
Enable 
Until a CSRconnect or CloudPayV2 shopping cart across multiple account numbers is available, billers will need to be able to search invoices in the biller portal and add them to a shopping cart for payment

RTDR - Override 6 Hour Previous RTDR Check
For Billers with RTDR, we normally would not pull a RTDR Balance if we had a successful balance within the past 6 hours. Enable this to Force a refresh.

ENABLE Multiple Customer Login Functionality
If enabled, the Biller will be able to use the Multiple Customer Login functionality in the Biller Portal as well as the Customer Portal. The Pay By Text and Autopay option will also be hidden through the payment route for non-authenticated sessions, and the use of saved method payments through the IVR will be disabled.
Enable - required for integration
