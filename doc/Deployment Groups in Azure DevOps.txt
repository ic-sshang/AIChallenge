Introduction to Deployment Groups in Azure DevOps
Purpose
This page serves as a guide for engineers outside the Platform team to understand 
Deployment Groups
 in Azure DevOps, their use cases, benefits, and how they can be utilized for targeted deployments across different environments (e.g., lab, dev, prod). Whether you're working in development, QA, or operations, this page will help you grasp how Deployment Groups can support your work.
What Are Deployment Groups?
Deployment Groups
 are collections of on-premises or virtual machines (VMs) that act as deployment targets for Azure DevOps pipelines. Each machine in the group runs an 
Azure Pipelines agent
 that listens for tasks from Azure DevOps and executes them. Deployment Groups allow you to:
Organize servers by environment (e.g., lab, dev, prod).
Execute deployment tasks (e.g., scripts, application installs, or updates) on specific servers.
Manage deployments in a controlled and automated manner.
Why Should You Care?
Deployment Groups are useful for engineers outside the Platform team because they provide:
Consistency Across Environments
:
You can ensure deployments are executed consistently across lab, dev, and prod environments.
Targeted Deployments
:
Control which servers or environments receive specific updates, avoiding accidental changes in other environments.
Automation and Scalability
:
Eliminate manual deployment tasks and scale deployments across multiple servers with ease.
Improved Collaboration
:
Teams can work together seamlessly by using Deployment Groups to manage environment-specific tasks.
Key Features of Deployment Groups
Environment Segmentation
:
You can create separate Deployment Groups for lab, dev, staging, and production environments.
Azure Pipelines Agent
:
Each server in the Deployment Group runs an agent that executes pipeline tasks. This ensures deployments are automated and monitored.
Role-Based Targeting
:
Deployment Groups can be filtered by tags, enabling you to target specific roles (e.g., web servers, database servers).
Pipeline Integration
:
Deployment Groups can be used in release pipelines to automate application deployments, configuration changes, or script execution.
How Does It Work?
Here’s an example of how Deployment Groups are used:
Setup
:
Engineers in the Platform team create Deployment Groups for lab, dev, and prod environments.
Azure Pipelines agents are installed on the target servers in each environment.
Using Deployment Groups
:
You, as an application or QA engineer, can leverage these Deployment Groups in release pipelines to:
Deploy your code to a specific environment.
Run scripts (e.g., cleanup, database updates, or configuration changes).
Perform smoke testing on targeted servers.
Monitoring
:
Azure DevOps provides visibility into the status of tasks executed on servers in the Deployment Group, helping you identify issues if they arise.
Step-by-Step Guide: How to Use Deployment Groups
Step 1: Understand the Environment Setup
Deployment Groups are organized by environment (e.g., lab, dev, prod).
Each server in the group has an Azure Pipelines agent installed and configured.
Step 2: Define Your Pipeline
Work with the Platform team to integrate your application or script into a release pipeline.
Choose the appropriate Deployment Group as the target for your tasks.
Step 3: Run Your Deployment
Trigger the release pipeline and monitor task execution on the targeted servers.
You can execute tasks like:
Deploying applications.
Running scripts (e.g., cleanup or removal scripts).
Applying configuration updates.
Step 4: Monitor Results
Use Azure DevOps logs and dashboards to track the status of your deployment and troubleshoot any issues.
Example Use Case
Scenario
: Running a Cleanup Script in Development Environment
Objective
: Remove temporary files on all development servers after testing.
Steps
:
Use the "Dev Servers" Deployment Group in Azure DevOps.
Add a script task to the release pipeline that targets the Deployment Group.
Trigger the pipeline to execute the cleanup script on all servers in the "Dev Servers" group.
Verify the logs to ensure the script was executed successfully on each server.
Benefits of Deployment Groups for Non-Platform Teams
Simplified Collaboration
:
You don’t need to worry about managing server configurations or direct access to environments; the Platform team handles setup, and you just target the Deployment Group.
Environment-Specific Deployments
:
Deployments can be targeted to specific environments without affecting others, ensuring safe and isolated changes.
Time Savings
:
Automated deployments reduce the time needed for manual tasks, allowing you to focus on your core responsibilities.
Error Reduction
:
Deployment Groups provide consistency and automation, reducing the likelihood of human errors during deployments.
Best Practices for Using Deployment Groups
Coordinate with the Platform Team
:
Work closely with the Platform team to understand the setup of Deployment Groups and ensure your pipeline configurations align with organizational standards.
Use Tags for Targeting
:
If you need to deploy or run tasks on specific servers within a Deployment Group, use tags to filter and target those servers.
Test in Lower Environments First
:
Always test your deployments in lab or dev environments before targeting staging or production.
Monitor Logs
:
Review logs and dashboards in Azure DevOps to confirm successful execution and troubleshoot any issues.
Document Your Pipeline
:
Maintain clear documentation of your release pipeline and how it interacts with Deployment Groups for future reference.
Conclusion
Deployment Groups are a powerful Azure DevOps feature that enables targeted, automated deployments across different environments. Whether you're deploying applications, running scripts, or managing configurations, Deployment Groups simplify the process, improve consistency, and enhance collaboration across teams.
By leveraging Deployment Groups, engineers outside the Platform team can focus on their core tasks without worrying about server configurations or manual deployments.
