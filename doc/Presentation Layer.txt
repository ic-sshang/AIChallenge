Provides a responsive and intuitive interface.
User Experience (UX)

Ensures the application is easy to use and navigate.

Data Presentation
:
Formats data received from the Business Logic Layer for display.
Handles data validation and error messages.
Interaction Handling
:
Manages user events like clicks, inputs, and gestures.

Do not get hung up on specific technologies for graphical user interfaces.   Presentation layers can also be command line jobs and web APIs.  It is the layer that the user interacts with to provide input and receive output.
