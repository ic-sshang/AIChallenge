Application deployments (run after Terraform changes)
These changes only impact ingress configurations so that the apps can work with the new Payer hostnames.  In prod, that only means removing configuration for 
payer.invoicecloud.com
 and 
www.invoicecloud.com
. 
payer-v3.invoicecloud.com
 will be the only supported hostname. It is also the only one that is actively in use today.
