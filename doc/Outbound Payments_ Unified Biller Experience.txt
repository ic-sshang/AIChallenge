 1. Problem 
Disjointed user experience
: Carriers must sign into 
two separate reporting portals
 (inbound and outbound), creating friction and wasted time.
Competitive disadvantage
: One Inc. offers a 
single, unified portal
, positioning them ahead in sales conversations.
Fragmented financial visibility
: Billers cannot easily view a 
comprehensive customer payment history
 across inbound and outbound flows.
Operational inefficiencies
: Voids, stop payments, reconciliation, and exceptions require duplicative processes and monitoring.
Provide context on this project and explain how it fits into your organization's strategic goals.
 2. Value Proposition
 “A 
unified reporting and payments portal
 that gives carriers one seamless experience across inbound and outbound transactions, reducing friction, enhancing financial visibility, and closing competitive gaps.”
Key differentiators:
Single sign-on experience
 (one portal instead of two).
Unified reporting view
 across inbound and outbound.
Streamlined workflows
 for voids, stop payments, reconciliation, and exceptions.
Competitive parity (and differentiation)
 vs. One Inc. and fintechs offering only inbound/outbound
 Assumptions
List any assumptions you have about your users, technical constraints, or business goals.
 3. Solution (Proposed Scope) 
Unified reporting access
 across inbound and outbound platforms.
Single portal experience
 with seamless authentication between solutions.
Integrated reporting functions
:
Payment reporting
Voids and stop payments
Reconciliation reporting
Exceptions management and notifications
