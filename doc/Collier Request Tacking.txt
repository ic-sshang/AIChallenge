With the addition of the new Total Amount Field, they now have 4 fields they want to display: Total amount, service address, balance due, and invoice date.  Currently invoice date is missing, so the sorting on the table is wrong (by total amount).
We currently support 4 columns in guest checkout.

The ask is for standard account status functionality, a normal feature in the utility space.
Payers are paying the after hours fee on cloudstore, but don’t know that they need to also pay their bill, or trucks won’t roll in the morning.  Can’t just include it in the amount due.
They want clear comm/badge for customer.
