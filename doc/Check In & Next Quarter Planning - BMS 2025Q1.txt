Current Quarter Commits
List out current quarter commitments that are 
 At Risk or 
 Delayed. Link to Jira items. Provide an update for each item: Why is it delayed, is there a way to pull it back to green, or do we need to reset the date. If we are resetting the date, provide the new date the team believes it can hit.

Changes are going into Production on the evening of 2/13. The new auto conveyance similarity score will be 
enabled for a few billers initially
 and then rolled out to others after verifying results.

Change of path here
Initially, we intended to queue invoices if names didn’t match the account (but had 70-90% similarity) before processing them to allow billers to review them. However, this approach would require extensive changes to our file import process, increase development time, delay email notifications, and add extra work for billers.
Instead, we will enhance the existing Customer Conveyance report to include:
Date/time column
Previous Customer Name column
Name Similarity column
Default view of the last 30 days, sorted by the most recent
Accounts will be auto-conveyed if names are 70-90% similar, but billers can reverse the any conveyances with 1 click if needed. This will reduce biller workload, ensure timely customer notifications, and minimize incorrect auto conveyances. Using the new Similarity Score, billers can easily see accounts most likely to require a conveyance reversal.
We are currently 25% through this update, aiming for a release on March 12.
