Health checks generated by the tool can be invoked in two ways either by a command line switch or environment variable.  Once invoked the job will run the health checks and exit.   Any health checks that fail will result in a non-zero exit code.
Command Line
myjob.exe healthcheck
Environment Variable
SET healthcheck=healthcheck
myjob.exe
Logging
The health checks will log result entries by way of integrating into the existing logging components used by the application.  For .Net 4.8 Skybot jobs this is typically STDOUT (Console.WriteLine) and New Relic via Serilog configurations.
