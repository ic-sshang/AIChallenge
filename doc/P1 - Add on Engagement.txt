Overview


Overview


This is the project engagement phase. The IS will reach out to the Biller to confirm scope of work, provide overview of implementation process and address any initial questions to begin Add on implementation. At this initial contact with the Biller, available self-guided, and instructor-led trainings are provided to ensure that the Biller can complete these trainings in the tight turnaround timeframe of an Add on. As well, the IS will reach out to the Software Partner if necessary for the integration and include any internal stakeholders previously identified. The IS as well will prep initial Products in the CRM related to first steps of the Add on Project.
