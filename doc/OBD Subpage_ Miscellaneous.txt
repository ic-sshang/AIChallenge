 Pricing Increases
At this time, no changes to pricing will be included at initial launch. A lot of work has been put into improving the OBD product over the past year and these upcoming changes will continue to improve the biller experience creating an opportunity for pricing modifications. This is an area that is planned for review, however, the priority is to successfully launch the program, then review pricing opportunities. 
New Billers - New billers would be priced at the new rate when using the new OBD process. Sales, boarding and finance will work together to finalize the details for implementing the pricing increase for new billers as well as any pricing changes on contract renewals. Phase 1 pricing could be implemented when we transition. Phase 1 to include new billers as well as consideration on any existing contract renewal. 
Existing Billers - Existing billers may experience OBD pricing changes based on their upcoming renewals. Additional pricing enhancements would require a more thorough review as pricing modifications may require signed amendments which introduces attrition risk. Recommendation is to consider pricing changes holistically and focus on pricing modifications as a phase 2 project.
