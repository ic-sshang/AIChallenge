Load Test Overview
There are 3 JMeter scripts used for Load Testing that exercise each of the main 3 InvoiceCloud Web Applications:
CRM
Biller Portal
Customer Portal
Customer Portal
NonProd: 
Kenya.Koch@ictest.com
QA-Regression and Prod: 
SusannaConroy81@ictest.com
However, we will not use Username and Password directly in the script, follow the below steps to setup the JMeter Script prior to running.
In the JMeter script we will capture the User’s ETG from the Biller Portal and embed the ETG Value in the JMeter Script.
 will see if we can dynamically capture the Session ID, if not, this will need to be captured from the Biller Poral hop to Customer Portal and then embedded into the Script or set as an Environment Variable.
