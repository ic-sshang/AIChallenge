Integrator Web Services
Summary:  This custom integration for Empro utilizes the Origami Risk system. Currently, Empro is transitioning from the Delphi/Oasis system to Origami, necessitating the simultaneous use of both systems. During this transition, invoices will be processed based on their invoice type ID. This is roughly a 2 year transition.
This is a balance forward integration.
Invoices with an invoice type ID of “164”,”165”,”166” will follow the Delphi/Oasis route, which operates on a batch file basis.
Invoices with an invoice type ID of “
167
” will be processed using the Origami Risk real-time design.

Assumptions/Requirements
Steps

Sample
User Registration
User registration happens after BIF upload. Not all Empro users are necessarily IC customers. Only insured customers are users on IC. 
Assumptions:
Empro knows if an insured is registered with InvoiceCloud
Empro stores Remote Authentication Token (per session) for use in 
CloudSSO Redirect User using the pre-defined URL
Requirement:
LogintypeID (REST- Remote Authentication- Register Accounts) is always = 
5
 
Check to see if account exists in invoice cloud and if it is registered. When user clicks on “Make Payment”
If account does not exist:
Create Customer Record

Registered User Payment
A registered user is logged in and makes payments on an account.
Assumption:
User is already registered and authenticated
Empro stores Remote Authentication Token from Remote Authentication web service
Empro redirects to IC Portal Customer Portal Recent Bill Listing
CloudSSOConnect (redirect 1 = Customer Portal Recent Bill Listing)
AutoPay Enrollment- Phase 2
 
A registered user is logged in to Empro portal and navigates to IC screen to enroll or unenroll autopay option.
Empro also has the option to update via API.
Assumption:
User is already registered and authenticated
Empro redirects (IC SSO Portal)  to Customer Portal AutoPay Settings screen
CloudSSOConnect (redirect 3 = Customer Portal AutoPay Settings
)
 
 
Manage Payment Methods
A registered user is logged in to Empro portal and navigates to IC screen to store, update or remove payment methods.
Assumption:
User is already registered and authenticated
Empro redirects (IC SSO Portal)  to Payment Methods screen
CloudSSOConnect (redirect 5 = Customer Portal Payment Options)
